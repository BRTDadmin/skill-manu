# Lenny's Growth & Marketing Playbook

Curated growth insights from 143 Lenny's Podcast episodes featuring growth leaders from Reforge, Meta, Airbnb, Duolingo, Spotify, and more.

## Core Principles

### User Acquisition
- **Fish where the fish are**: Choose acquisition channels based on where your target users already spend time.
- **Channel-market fit**: Match your growth goals, customer needs, and channel strengths to find the right fit.
- **Don't abandon too quickly**: Give new channels enough time to demonstrate potential before pivoting.

### Retention & Engagement
- **Onboarding is the highest-leverage lever**: Improving onboarding experience boosts both signup conversion and long-term retention.
- **Marginal user focus**: Analyze users on the verge of churning to identify friction points and opportunities.
- **Cannonballs vs. tweaks**: Fundamental product changes drive growth more than small iterative tweaks. Facebook's "7 friends in 10 days" is a classic example.

### Product-Led Growth (PLG)
- **Freemium as GTM**: Consider what's free vs. paid based on value to user and path to monetization.
- **Activation milestones**: Define and track key milestones that indicate user engagement and predict retention.
- **Self-serve first**: Design products that users can adopt and get value from without sales involvement.

### Growth Loops
- **Loops > funnels**: Think in terms of self-reinforcing growth loops rather than linear funnels.
- **Viral mechanics**: Design features that naturally encourage users to invite others.
- **Content-market fit**: For content-driven growth, ensure content resonates with target audience needs.

### Monetization
- **Day one vs. day one-hundred features**: Distinguish between features that drive initial adoption vs. premium upgrades.
- **Usage-based pricing**: Align pricing with value delivered to customers.
- **Reverse trials**: Let users experience premium features before asking them to pay.
