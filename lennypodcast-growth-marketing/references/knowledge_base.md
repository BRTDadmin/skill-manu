# Lenny Growth Marketing Knowledge Base

Curated insights from 143 Lenny's Podcast episodes.

## Ada Chen Rekhi

- Ada led LinkedIn's marketing efforts for their growth team.

## Adam Grenier

- When exploring new acquisition channels, use a framework that considers your growth goals, your customer's needs, and the channel's strengths to find the right fit.
- Don't abandon a new channel too quickly; give it enough time to demonstrate its potential.
- The role of a Growth CMO is emerging, combining expertise in both marketing and product development.
- Marketing leaders can increase their effectiveness by understanding the principles of product development.
- A CMO may not be a good fit if they are not data-driven, lack a deep understanding of the product, or are not a compelling storyteller.

## Adriel Frederick

- Improving the onboarding experience is one of the most impactful levers for boosting both signup conversion rates and long-term user retention.
- A key to growth is understanding the 'marginal user'—the user who is on the verge of churning or not fully activating—and analyzing their experience to identify friction points and opportunities.
- 'Cannonballs' are fundamental, step-change product modifications made to drive growth optimization, as opposed to small, iterative tweaks. A classic example is Facebook's '7 friends in 10 days' initiative.

## Albert Cheng

- Growth as the job is to connect users to the value of your product. Growth sometimes gets this reputation that it’s just pure metrics hacking.
- User retention is gold for consumer subscription companies. If you don’t retain your users, then a lot of the onus is on getting them to pay on day one.
- The lived product experience for most of the free users was that Grammarly was just a product to fix your spelling and grammar because those were the free suggestions. What if we actually sampled a number of different paid suggestions and interspersed them to free users across their writing? All of a sudden, people were seeing Grammarly as a much more powerful tool than they were before.
- Yeah, I initially came up or heard with, heard about explore and exploit through my engineering partner at Grammarly. The gist of it is that when you’re in exploratory mode, think of it as finding the right mountain to climb. And then when you’re in exploitation mode, you’re climbing that mountain. If you do too much exploration, you can have your team feel a little bit too scattershot, just trying a hundred different things. And if you do too much in exploitation, which is often the MO of growth teams, it can lead to this saturation and stagnation of ideas. So I’ll give you a concrete example. So I work at chess.com and one of our priorities is to encourage chess players to invite their friends to play chess. So you play a game of chess, after the game is over, we have this virtual coach that teaches you about your worst moves, your best moves, and so on. And what he observes is that 80% of people that review their games actually do so after a win. And that’s really counterintuitive because you would think that after a loss, you’re more motivated to learn from your mistakes. That turned out not to be the truth when it came to the human psychology and the actual data of it. And so we made some changes to the product. When you lose a game now as opposed to surfacing your blunders and your horrible stuff that you did, we flip it on its head and we show you, “Hey, you actually played pretty well for the first 20 moves, but you made this one mistake at the very end.” That change alone was pretty dramatic for us. It grew game reviews by 25%, subscriptions by 20%, user retention by a lot. Now, adjacent product managers like the PM working on puzzles can now think about, “Okay, how do I audit these cold patterns and apply it to my product?” I can change the success rating, I could tweak some copy, change the color of some buttons, and so you now can take this insight and exploit it across the entire company. So when done right, you can oscillate between the two until you saturate out of exploitation mode and then you encourage your team to go back to exploration.
- Yeah, exactly right. In my experience, the typical win rate, and I hate to use that term for experiments, but it’s around 10 to 20%. Usually you’re trying a bunch of things, a lot of hypotheses turn out not to be true, consumer products are very unpredictable. Surfacing those across the company, the original PM running that experiment doesn’t necessarily need to be the person that exploits it across the company. So it’s just oscillating back and forth between the two. That is the magic bullet.
- Yeah, so when I joined Grammarly, the lived product experience for most of the free users was that Grammarly was just a product to fix your spelling and grammar because those were the free suggestions. What if we actually sampled a number of different paid suggestions and interspersed them to free users across their writing? All of a sudden, people were seeing Grammarly as a much more powerful tool than they were before. And so that was a huge win for us. It doubled the number of upgrades to our paid plan. And it was just a really good example of how you can use the free product to showcase the value of the paid product.
- Exactly. Yeah. And I think that’s a really important point, which is that a lot of companies, they have this time-based trial where you get access to all the premium features for seven days. And then after seven days, you lose access to all of them. And I think that’s a really bad experience because you’re basically telling the user, “Hey, you’re not good enough to use our product.” And so what we did at Grammarly was we basically said, “Hey, you can use all of our premium features, but you can only use them on a small subset of your writing.” And so that was a much better experience because you’re still getting the value of the product, but you’re also seeing the value of the paid product.
- User retention is gold for consumer subscription companies. If you don’t retain your users, then a lot of the onus is on getting them to pay on day one. And so what we found at Duolingo was that if you can get a user to come back on day one, they’re much more likely to come back on day seven. And if you can get them to come back on day seven, they’re much more likely to come back on day 30. And so we had a whole team that was just focused on day one retention. And then we had another team that was focused on day seven retention. And then we had another team that was focused on day 30 retention. And so it was a very systematic way of thinking about retention.
- Yeah, so I think it depends on the category. So for Duolingo, we were looking at day one retention of around 50%. And then for day seven retention, we were looking at around 20%. And then for day 30 retention, we were looking at around 10%. And so that was for a free app. For a paid app, you would expect those numbers to be a lot higher.
- Yeah, so for a mature product, a lot of the growth comes from resurrected users. So these are users that have churned, but then they come back to the product. And so at Duolingo, we found that 80% of our growth was coming from resurrected users. And so we had a whole team that was just focused on resurrecting users. And so we would send them emails, we would send them push notifications, we would do all sorts of things to get them to come back to the product.
- Yeah, so we’re using AI in a couple of different ways. One is that we’re using it to generate hypotheses. So we have a team of data scientists that are constantly looking at the data and they’re trying to find patterns in the data. And then they’ll come to the growth team and they’ll say, “Hey, we found this interesting pattern. We think that if we do this, then we can increase retention by X percent.” And so that’s one way that we’re using AI. The other way that we’re using AI is that we’re using it to personalize the product. So for example, at Duolingo, we have a bunch of different characters. And so we can use AI to figure out which character is the most effective at teaching you a new language. And so we can personalize the product for each individual user.

## Alex Hardiman

- The New York Times's impact and business goals are in service of its mission to seek the truth and help people understand the world.
- Growing subscribers is a key metric, but impact is also when a deeply reported story triggers an important policy change or a new law.

## Amjad Masad

- Expect software consumption to skyrocket as costs drop. This is the “Jevons paradox” in action: as the cost of building software goes down, the volume of software being created will go up. Expect more people to launch businesses, create tools, and iterate on existing products. The cost-effectiveness of AI-driven development will make it easier for anyone to start building something new.

## Andrew Wilkinson

## Arielle Jackson

- A good company name is often suggestive or evocative, hinting at the product's function or benefit in a way that becomes clear once you understand the company (e.g., 'Seesaw' for an ed-tech tool that facilitates back-and-forth between students and teachers).
- Empty vessel names (e.g., 'Yahoo,' 'Eero') can succeed but require more marketing effort to imbue them with meaning.
- A structured naming process is crucial. It should involve brainstorming sessions and clear criteria, such as being short, memorable, easy to say, and emotionally resonant.
- The 'bar test' is a simple and effective way to test your positioning: Can you explain what your company does to someone in a bar in a single, compelling sentence?
- To build a brand personality, you can use the 'five big brand descriptions' framework.
- Brand and product positioning documents should be actively integrated into the company's workflow, not just stored away in a folder.
- Startups can gain PR by crafting a compelling story and building relationships with journalists, rather than just cold-emailing them.
- The right time to hire a marketer is typically after achieving product-market fit and when you're ready to scale growth.

## Meltem Kuran Berkowitz

- Leverage low-cost growth channels by answering questions where your audience is, like Reddit, Quora, and other communities.
- Don't try to sell; instead, add value by genuinely answering people's questions.
- Use tools like Syften to monitor keywords and conversations on platforms like Reddit.
- When starting out, focus on channels with a high concentration of your target audience, even if the total audience size is small.
- Early awareness campaigns in B2B can be a waste of time; focus on channels where you can directly address user needs.
- Paid ads are most effective when you have a solid product and a well-performing website.
- Deel uses a "traffic light system" to prioritize content creation based on SEO potential and audience interest.
- Closed communities (Slack, Discord, Facebook Groups) can be powerful channels if you can gain access and provide value.

## Bangaly Kaba

- Understanding “adjacent users” can be a key to unlocking new stages of growth. Adjacent users are the next segment of people who can benefit from your product and are showing interest but are not quite converting and retaining how you’d hope. You can identify these users by looking for cohorts showing signals that your product is almost a fit (e.g. signing up) but not quite working (e.g. churning at high rates). For example, at one point, Instacart’s core user base may have been office admins ordering food for their staff, but the adjacent user was a mom of four ordering groceries. The mom of four has very different needs, so it would be important for Instacart to build for those in order to grow into the new segment.

## Ben Williams

- Snyk acquired its first 100 users by engaging with the developer community at conferences and meetups.
- GitHub can be a powerful growth lever for developer-focused products.

## Casey Winters

- New growth trends include a focus on product-led growth (PLG), community-building, and content marketing.
- 'Kindle strategies' are non-scalable hacks that are used to get initial traction. 'Fire strategies' are scalable channels that can drive long-term growth. The goal of kindle strategies is to unlock fire strategies.
- Underappreciated growth strategies include international expansion, partnerships, and affiliate marketing.
- You should focus on growth once you have achieved product-market fit.
- Growth loops are systems where the output of one cycle becomes the input for the next cycle, leading to compounding growth. Coda is a good example of a company with strong content loops.

## Cassidy Williams

- Developer Relations (DevRel) is a key activity for companies targeting developers, involving both virtual and in-person events to build community and product awareness.

## Chamath Palihapitiya

- Growth hacking involves focusing on core actions and removing friction to make it easier for users to take those actions. A classic example from Facebook is the '7 friends in 10 days' metric.

## Charlie Munger

- A strong brand can lead to significant pricing power, as seen with See's Candies, where prices were raised 10% annually without affecting volume.
- Creating a brand that people trust and are loyal to, like Hermes, can take a century of consistent effort.
- For certain products, like sauces with a unique flavor, brand loyalty can be so strong that one company can dominate the market.

## Chenell Basilio

- It takes a minimum of two to three years to grow a newsletter to 50,000 subscribers or achieve a meaningful income, unless you already have a large following.
- Starting with great, unique content is essential for growth, as it encourages sharing and enables the use of various growth tactics.
- Content that takes a significant amount of time and effort to create tends to perform the best.

- Actionable content, such as frameworks and templates, is valuable to readers and encourages them to keep coming back.
- Consistency in publishing is the most effective growth tactic.
- Patience is crucial, as significant growth does not happen overnight.

- A clear value proposition for a newsletter makes it easier for people to understand the benefits of subscribing.
- High-quality content is more likely to be shared, amplifying its reach.
- Engaging with and building a community around your content can significantly contribute to growth.

## Claire Hughes Johnson

- When hiring for a role like 'VP of Marketing' in an early-stage startup, be flexible with titles. Use titles like 'Head of' or 'Growth Lead' to avoid having to 'take away' a title later when you hire a more senior person.
- You can be creative about how you represent your scope to external partners. For example, instead of 'VP of Sales,' you could say, 'I'm in charge of optimization for our payments product.'

## Cristina Cordova

- Find a company that's building a product so good that its users can't stop talking about it. This points to the power of word-of-mouth marketing and product-led growth.

## Dan Hockenmaier

- Retention is more important than growth in the early stages.
- The early user experience is critical for retention.
- Virality and paid marketing can be powerful growth loops.
- When you have a marketplace, you need to think about both supply and demand acquisition.

- Use ROI equations to understand the value of different growth initiatives.

## Jules Walter

- At Slack, optimizing the pricing page by moving information around led to an increase in purchases.
- A simple onboarding experiment on Slack's mobile app, which explained what Slack is and linked to a guide, significantly increased user retention.

## David Perell

- A successful first piece of content can provide the confidence to continue creating.
- Building a following on a platform like Twitter in parallel with writing longer-form content is a powerful strategy for audience growth.

- Guest posts on relevant, high-traffic blogs are a valuable tool for early-stage audience growth.
- Creating in-depth, high-effort content series can lead to exponential growth in subscribers.
- Word-of-mouth marketing, driven by valuable content, is a key driver of growth.

## David Singleton

- Our core thesis is that the internet economy is going to be much bigger and more important in the future than it is today. And that we have a lot of work to do to build the infrastructure that’s going to power that. And so we are really a business full of product minded builders who are seeking to make it easier for businesses to get started and to scale. And so that mindset I think attracts a certain kind of person who wants to take a lot of agency, wants to understand the problem that they’re solving and then wants to go and build a great solution to it.

## Deborah Liu

- When building a new product, focus on the use case and the customer. Passion for the product and a deep understanding of the customer's needs can make up for a lack of formal experience.

- Giving the product away for free can be a more effective growth strategy than paid advertising by removing the barrier to entry.
- Word-of-mouth is the most powerful acquisition channel, amplified when users share what they have built with the product.
- Community-led growth, by providing value and help in relevant online communities, is a key acquisition strategy.
- Product-led acquisition, where the product itself drives user acquisition through usage and sharing, creates a powerful growth loop.
- Retention has shifted from a focus on daily habits (DAUs, WAUs, MAUs) to project-based retention, being the go-to tool for a specific job-to-be-done.
- Monetization is moving from fixed pricing to usage-based models to align with the varying value users receive.
- Companies should focus on creating a portfolio of revenue streams rather than relying on a single pricing model.

- A key growth tactic for Sprig in its early days was direct, in-person user acquisition.

## Gib Biddle

- Word-of-mouth is a powerful growth driver, and delighting customers can lead to increased word-of-mouth, even if it doesn't directly impact retention.

## Guillermo Rauch

- Vercel's growth is demonstrated by its ability to power high-traffic websites for major events like the Super Bowl, showcasing the scalability of its platform.

- By the time Notion introduced paid plans, it had built a loyal user base that was willing to pay for the product.

## Jeff Weinstein

- If users aren’t clamoring for your product, you’re not solving a real need.
- When customers take the time to complain or provide feedback, treat it as a gift.
- Respond promptly to complaints or feedback, even if it means interrupting other tasks, as it creates a direct signal between you and the customer. This responsive attitude can lead to a loyal customer base and product improvement.

## Jen Abel

- Cold outreach is still effective, especially cold calling, which can have higher response rates than email.
- The three main channels for outreach are LinkedIn, email, and cold calling.
- For outreach messages, focus on relevance, a novel or counterintuitive insight, the problem (not the solution), and conciseness (3-4 sentences).
- Win rate is a more important metric than conversion rate in the early stages. A high win rate (30-40%) means you need fewer leads.
- Don't just claim your product is "better," show how it's "different."

## Jeremy Henrickson

- The case for expanding internationally before you think you’re ready: If you wait until you're ready, you'll be too late. It's better to go early and learn as you go.

- Lowering price by a dollar, lowering delivery times by a minute, or adding a new restaurant to the platform in a particular area are all levers that can be quantified in terms of their impact on a common metric like gross order value (GOV).

## Jessica Hische

- For startups, it's more important to focus on building a valuable product than to perfect the logo and branding from the start. A 'good enough' logo is sufficient initially and can be refined as the company grows.
- A strong brand identity, where all visual elements like typography, color, and illustrations are cohesive, enhances brand recognition and fosters a stronger emotional connection with the audience.
- A flashy brand cannot compensate for a product that lacks substance. The primary focus should always be on providing real value to users.

## Jiaona Zhang

- When launching a new product or tier, like Airbnb Plus, the primary goal was to acquire a new segment of users who previously did not trust the platform, demonstrating a targeted growth strategy.
- It is critical to validate the unit economics of a new product or feature from the very beginning to ensure its long-term viability and profitability.

## John Cutler

- Product evangelism is a high-leverage role that can drive growth by building a community and sharing knowledge about the product.

## Jonathan Becker

- The terms 'performance marketing,' 'paid acquisition,' and 'paid growth' are often used interchangeably to refer to the practice of spending money to acquire customers.
- Avoid over-reliance on a single marketing channel. A diversified marketing mix (e.g., email, direct mail, SEO, paid channels) is crucial for sustainable growth, similar to a diversified investment portfolio.
- Businesses that rely on a single 'hack' or loophole on a platform are at high risk when that loophole is closed.
- For early-stage companies without product-market fit, performance marketing is challenging but can work.
- For later-stage companies, the focus of performance marketing shifts from 'does it work?' to 'at what scale can it work?'.
- A 'good business,' characterized by high LTV and fast time to value, is a strong candidate for successful paid acquisition.
- The first step in a paid growth strategy is to clearly define your goals (e.g., rapid scaling, profitability, learning, validation).
- The second and third steps are to define your budget and the channels you will use.
- Google and Facebook are the largest and most common channels for scaling quickly.
- TikTok is an effective channel for visual products and can offer lower-cost scale due to a less competitive ad auction.
- For B2B marketing, LinkedIn and Google are the most effective channels because they allow for targeting based on job titles.
- Attribution is complex; it's best to use a combination of attribution models (last-click, first-click, linear, time-decay) to get a comprehensive understanding of what is working.

## Julian Shapiro

- Product-led acquisition (PLA) is the use of the product itself as the primary driver of new customer acquisition, rather than relying on traditional marketing and sales tactics.
- The three categories of product-led acquisition are embedded virality, billboarding (where product usage is visible to non-users), and user-generated content (UGC).
- To improve user retention, focus on 'building state,' which involves helping users accrue non-transferable value within the product, such as reputation or a customized experience.
- Effective writing combines novelty (providing new, surprising information) with resonance (using stories, analogies, and examples to make the information memorable).
- Threads are a primary driver of follower growth on Twitter, but focusing on original, insightful content attracts a higher quality audience.

## Karri Saarinen

- Linear has been profitable for the last two years, demonstrating a sustainable business model.
- The company's growth is driven by a customer-focused approach, believing that a product people love to use will lead to business success.

- Pricing strategies were initially based on competitor analysis and then refined through customer feedback.

## Kayvon Beykpour

- Periscope's failure was partly due to poor retention, which was masked by explosive growth in new markets.

## Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter

- Community Notes can reduce engagement with misleading content by 50% to 60%.
- Authors of posts that receive a Community Note are 80% more likely to delete their post.

## Kevin Aluwi

- For the first six months after launching our app, we had only raised about $2 million and our regional competitor had already raised $400 million. So it's easy to talk about what we built as this kind of giant business, but we came from a place where we were seriously outgunned and out-capitalized. And I think brand was a huge part of why we were able to win.
- And so branding is not just cool logo, cool advertising, fun imagery, but it's really about the impression that a customer has of your company. So how you write copy and advertising and in the app, how you've even designed the app, but we were the first company of our scale to really embrace colloquial Indonesian in our marketing and in our app.
- One of my favorite cultural artifacts is that in Asia it's fairly common to send food as gifts to your loved ones or maybe to your colleagues. And so when we launched our food delivery service, a lot of people were actually using it for this, I'm going to send it to my girlfriend, I'm going to send it to my parents, I'm going to send it to my colleagues. And so it became this whole cultural phenomenon of sending go-food for these people and we kind of lean into it in our product and in our marketing.

## Kevin Yien

## Lane Shackleton

- The creation of skippable YouTube ads was a result of focusing on user experience and finding a win-win solution for both users and advertisers. The insight was that if you give users a choice, they are more likely to engage with ads they are interested in.

## Laura Modi

- During a crisis (like the infant formula shortage), prioritizing existing customers over acquiring new ones (the 'slowth' strategy) can build long-term trust and brand loyalty.
- A strong brand is crucial for direct-to-consumer (DTC) success. Bobbie's brand was built on challenging the stigma around formula feeding and creating a product that parents could be proud to use.

## Lauryn Isford

- Experimentation should be used as a risk mitigation tool, not a default step for all product development. 
- A/B testing is not always necessary, especially when there is high confidence in a feature's positive impact. 
- A reverse trial model, which combines a free trial with a freemium plan, can be an effective strategy to leverage the benefits of both. 
- The PLG (Product-Led Growth) growth funnel framework helps in creating a shared understanding and clear communication across teams. 
- B2B growth is an emerging and exciting space with a lot of room for innovation.

## Lulu Cheng Meservey

- To make an idea spread, make it memorable and make people want to say it of their own volition.
- People share things to bring joy, make someone laugh, appear interesting, or project their identity.
- Use jokes, analogies, and simple, colorful mental images to make ideas spread.
- Use stories and anecdotes instead of subjective adjectives.
- The "Put the pill in some cheese" analogy refers to crafting a story that will stick with people.
- Short, unusual phrases that are repeated become sticky (e.g., "software is eating the world").
- To create a sticky phrase, make it understandable to a second-grader, remove cliches, and use imagery or an analogy.
- Find your audience's "cultural erogenous zones" by shaping your message to fit their existing worldviews and passions.
- It's easier to connect your message to what people already care about than to change their passions.
- For underdogs and startups, acknowledge you can't use the incumbent's playbook.
- Build your own distribution from day one.
- Win hearts and minds by shaping your story to fit the audience's cultural erogenous zones and finding influencers to spread it.
- Use the concentric circles framework to spread information, starting from your core team and moving outwards.
- When using the concentric circles framework, be crisp on the message, focusing on one to three key facts.
- Provide incentives for people to spread your message, such as helping others or gaining social proof.

## Madhavan Ramanujam

- To build an enduring business, you must dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both.
- Don't focus on a single engine strategy (market share vs. wallet share). You need to do both, but not with equal effort at all times.
- For gaining market share, you need a great product and a great go-to-market strategy. For gaining wallet share, you need to have a great monetization and pricing strategy.

## Madhavan Ramanujam

- Three pricing strategies: maximizing (for market leaders), penetrating (to gain market share), and skimming (for innovative products).
- How you charge is more important than how much you charge.
- Bundling and packaging can be used to unlock segmentation.
- Behavioral pricing tactics include charm pricing (e.g., $9.99), price anchoring, and decoy pricing.
- In a depressed market, focus on communicating value and consider offering more flexible payment terms.

## Manik Gupta

- For consumer apps, focus on 1-2 core features that solve a critical user problem rather than building 20 features that detract from the user journey.

## Marc Benioff

- Your customers are your best salespeople. Share their stories—how they’re using your product and seeing real results. Use these stories across your marketing, especially for high-profile clients.

## Marty Cagan

- This episode does not focus on growth and marketing tactics.

## Matt Abrahams

- No specific points on growth and marketing.

## Matt Dixon

- Dialing up the FOMO backfires 87% of the time by actually increasing the odds your customer will be lost to no decision. Contrary to common belief, customers’ fear of messing up (FOMU) outweighs their fear of missing out on benefits (FOMO).
- Use “pings and echoes” to gently surface the customer’s fears and concerns without putting them on the defensive. Just like sonar detects objects underwater, salespeople can use a similar technique to gauge customer preferences and concerns: send out “pings” by articulating potential issues or questions and listen for “echoes,” the customer’s response or confirmation. This opens the door to an honest conversation.
- When customers are stuck in a place of indecision, apply the JOLT method to jolt them into action:
    - **Judge** their level of indecision: Start by assessing your customer’s level of indecision. This involves understanding if they are overwhelmed by choices, still in the research phase, or concerned about the risk involved in the purchase.
    - **Offer** a recommendation: Once you have gauged their indecision, offer them a recommendation tailored to their situation. This recommendation should guide them toward making a decision by providing clarity and direction.
    - **Limit** the exploration: Encourage your customers to stop endless research and start trusting you as the expert. Help them narrow down their options and focus on what truly matters for their needs.
    - **Take** risk off the table: Address any concerns about risk associated with the purchase by (1) proactively resetting expectations, not letting the customer anchor on the most spectacular case studies, and (2) establishing “safety net” options like implementation support, specialized terms, and close collaboration to ensure the customer achieves their goals.

## Matthew Dicks

- Scaling a company often involves a series of J-curves, where you experience a dip in performance or comfort before seeing significant growth. This is a natural part of the process.
- Don't be afraid to 'give away your Legos' – meaning, delegate tasks and responsibilities you've mastered to others. This is crucial for both your own growth and the company's ability to scale.
- The most successful companies are often those that are willing to constantly reinvent themselves and their products.

## Naomi Gleit

- Your activation metric doesn’t have to be perfect. Choose something your team can rally around, like “7 friends in 10 days.” What matters most is that it gives everyone a common goal to work toward.
- Facebook's early growth team focused on getting users to '7 friends in 10 days' as their north star metric.

## Naomi Ionita

- When changing pricing, don't just change the number. Change the value metric, the features included in each plan, and the overall packaging.
- There are two types of retention: strategic and tactical. Strategic retention is about the long-term, while tactical retention is about the short-term actions to reduce churn.
- Tactical retention is often missed but can have a big impact. Examples include dunning emails, credit card updaters, and term optimization.
- The middle of the funnel is the biggest opportunity for growth. This is where you can educate and nurture leads who are not yet ready to buy.
- Don't just focus on the top of the funnel (acquisition) or the bottom of the funnel (closing deals).

## Ryan Hoover

- To get your first users, do things that don't scale. Go out and find your users one by one.
- Figure out where your users hang out online and offline and go to them.

- Successful products are incredibly easy to get started with and provide a delightful first experience that makes users want to return.
- Avoid trying to be everything to everyone; a product that lacks focus will ultimately be nothing to no one.

## Sean Ellis

- Prioritize growth investments in the following order: Activation/onboarding, Engagement, Referral, Revenue model, and Acquisition.
- To improve customer activation, identify the root cause of low rates by directly surveying users. Often, the issue is a lack of understanding of the product’s features and benefits, which can be addressed by refining positioning and messaging.
- The Dropbox referral program was a significant driver of its growth, highlighting the power of word-of-mouth marketing.
- Freemium models can be an effective strategy for driving user engagement and growth.

## Shishir Mehrotra

- Black and Blue Loops: Shishir Mehrotra introduced the concept of 'black loops' and 'blue loops' for product growth. The 'black loop' is the mechanical process of how a product is shared (e.g., sending a link). The 'blue loop' is the emotional driver behind the sharing (e.g., wanting to collaborate with someone).
- Loops over Funnels: He advocates for thinking in terms of these loops rather than traditional funnels, as loops better represent the viral and emotional aspects of product growth.
- Discovering Loops: To identify a product's loops, Mehrotra suggests analyzing the language used to describe the product to new job candidates, as this often reveals the core value and sharing mechanisms.

## Shweta Shrivastava

- Waymo's go-to-market strategy is focused on building trust with riders and demonstrating the safety and reliability of its technology.

## Sri Batchu

- You start off with founder-led sales, then hire your first couple of salespeople, then you start some very low cost targeted marketing efforts like content, community, and small-scale events. After that, you move to PR, and then finally paid and brand efforts, with SEO starting around the same time as paid marketing.
- The progression of marketing channels is based on cost and effectiveness; as you understand your customers better, you can move to more expensive and effective channels.
- A 'cap table as a growth strategy' involves getting early-stage founders and influential operators as investors, who then become your initial customers.
- A growth engineering team dedicated to sales efficiency can be a huge unlock.
- A 'skunk works' team can be used to experiment with new, smaller-scale online and offline channels that can be scaled up if successful.

## Stewart Butterfield

- 'We Don't Sell Saddles Here': A famous memo written by Stewart Butterfield to the Slack team, emphasizing that they were not selling a product (a saddle) but a solution to a problem (organizational transformation). This helped the team focus on the core value proposition and communicate it effectively to customers.
- Word-of-Mouth Growth: The most powerful growth engine is a product that people love and are genuinely excited to share with others. Slack's early growth was heavily driven by this organic, word-of-mouth adoption.

## Tamar Yehoshua

- Harness the power of marketing: Treat your marketing efforts with the same strategic rigor as product development. Be bold, creative, and strategic in how you present and position your brand to maximize its impact.

## Tanguy Crusson

- To foster innovation within a large company, create artificial scarcity to emulate the 'starvation' that drives startups. This means operating as a small, scrappy, and siloed team.
- The most likely outcome for a new product is failure, so it's wise to avoid over-investing in the early stages.

## Timothy Davis

- Paid advertising is for everyone, but the channel mix depends on the industry and business model.
- Start with Google Search ads because of their high user intent.
- Expand to Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and YouTube if you have creative assets, especially video.
- Use LinkedIn for highly targeted B2B campaigns, but be mindful of the higher cost.
- When testing new platforms, begin with 1% look-alike audiences, which are the users most similar to your existing customers.
- Start with small budgets on new platforms to find 'signs of life' (positive engagement signals) before scaling up.
- Treat every campaign as an opportunity to either win or learn; don't get discouraged by underperformance.
- A common mistake is relying on a single campaign or platform for success; diversify your efforts.
- Contact your account representatives at Google, Meta, etc., to get competitor benchmarks on metrics like CPC, CTR, and conversion rates.
- Don't just copy what works on one platform to another; user behavior is different, so adapt your creative and strategy for each platform.

## Tobi Lütke

- Metrics are important, but they should support your decision-making, not drive it. Focus on things like joy, pride, and the satisfaction of a job well done. When people are passionate and enjoy their work, the numbers will follow.
- Playing positive-sum games with customers becomes the ultimate growth strategy.
- You need both a positional game (long-term strategy) and tactics (short-term wins). Too many focus only on tactics—getting the immediate conversion or winning the next A/B test. But true growth comes from setting yourself up for success in the long run, shaping your company’s role in the ecosystem, and building trust over time.

## Tom Conrad

- Pandora's growth was driven by word-of-mouth and the inherent virality of sharing music.
- The "thumbs up" feature in Pandora was a key driver of engagement and personalization, which in turn led to higher retention.

## Tomer Cohen

- When transforming the LinkedIn feed, the purpose was redefined to be about 'people that matter, talking about things that I care about professionally,' rather than being a simple springboard for other products or an upsell mechanism. (Tomer Cohen)
- To dramatically increase content creation, set an ambitious 10X goal and frame the opportunity by looking at the total potential market (all knowledge workers) rather than just extrapolating from current user numbers. (Tomer Cohen)

- Miro's growth is driven by a product-led growth motion with a freemium product, a viral loop, and a self-serve upgrade path.
- A sales-led motion focused on enterprise customers and specific use cases can be added on top of a PLG motion to drive further growth.
- Community-generated templates and content (Miroverse) can be a powerful growth lever.

## Vijay Iyengar

- A major pitfall when expanding a product line is taking people away from the core product, which leaves it vulnerable to disruption. Instead, new ventures should be funded by profits or external capital, not by reallocating core team members.
- If you are the market leader in a core product, you must continue to out-invest all competitors in that core area to maintain your leadership position.
- Expanding into adjacent product categories can result in building a collection of 'good enough' bolt-on products that are not best-in-class and fail to significantly drive revenue or growth, while distracting from the core offering.
- A bundle of 'good enough' products is only viable if it includes an indispensable anchor product that customers cannot give up.

## Yuhki Yamashita

- Figma's growth was significantly driven by cultivating a strong community of empowered users.

- The paid media landscape has changed significantly with the loss of signal from ATT, making channels like Facebook and Instagram less effective than they used to be.
- Companies should diversify their paid media mix and explore channels like TikTok, Snapchat, Pinterest, and Reddit.

- To test the incrementality of paid media spend, run experiments where you turn off spending in a specific channel or geography and measure the impact on your business.
- The biggest mistake in growth strategy is spreading yourself too thin. It's better to focus on one or two channels and master them before expanding.
- You know it's time to move on from a strategy when you see your growth slowing down, your customer acquisition cost going up, and your lifetime value going down.
- It's important to have a portfolio of bets in your growth strategy, with a mix of core channels that are driving growth and experimental channels that you are testing.
- There are two main reasons to do paid media: to drive growth and to learn about your customers, market, and messaging.
- Don't dismiss new channels like TikTok, as you never know where your next big growth channel will come from. Always be testing and experimenting.

## Adam Fishman

- If you're not different, you're a commodity and compete on price.
- Gong is a good example of a company that created and owned a new category (revenue intelligence).

## Bob Moesta

- Reducing friction in the buying process is often more effective than adding more features to a product.
- Instead of focusing on selling, focus on helping customers make progress in their lives. This is the core of demand-side sales.

- Significant investment is being made in brand marketing to establish Airbnb as a unique and dominant force in its category.

## Brian Rothenberg

- Eventbrite's growth was fueled by built-in organic levers like word-of-mouth and a viral loop where event attendees became event creators.
- To optimize the attendee-to-creator conversion, the team conducted qualitative surveys to understand the 'aha moment' and then ran A/B tests on product features like logo size and calls-to-action.
- Moving upmarket required shifting from B2C to B2B growth tactics, including building lead generation programs and marketing automation.
- A company's mission should be deeply tied to its growth strategy; Eventbrite's mission of accessibility led them to embrace free events, which became a powerful freemium acquisition channel.
- For international expansion, it's crucial to first achieve local product-market fit by adapting the product (e.g., payments, localization) and to build up supply in a new market before driving demand.
- Segmentation, pricing, and product packaging are powerful but often underused growth tactics.
- SimilarWeb is a valuable tool for competitive analysis and for reverse-engineering competitors' growth strategies.

## Brie Wolfson

- Marketing should be about telling the truth and closing the gap between a company's reality and its public perception.
- The most effective marketing is grounded in substance and craft. It's not about flashy campaigns, but about deeply understanding the product and the customer.

## Camille Ricketts

- Community-led growth is when your community helps you achieve such ubiquity and such name recognition that you're able to enter into sales conversations with a prospect and they already know what you are.
- The community is going to be our top of funnel.
- I love using the word discovery because I think that that is even a little bit like a step further than awareness. It's not just that you've heard of it, it's that you've been compelled to go check it out.
- When people think about acquisition or top of funnel, they think about how many people can I get to the website and then how many people can I get to sign up?

## Casey Winters

- There are different types of network effects (e.g., direct, indirect, two-sided) that can be leveraged for growth, and it's important to understand which ones apply to your product.
- A common mistake in growth is focusing too much on short-term hacks rather than building sustainable growth loops.

- A freemium model with a fully managed cloud service (like MongoDB Atlas) can be a successful monetization strategy.

## Emily Kramer

- Marketing efforts can be categorized into 'fuel' (content, positioning, messaging, design) and 'engine' (distribution channels like paid ads, SEO, email, events, partnerships, and marketing ops).
- A company needs 'fuel' before it can effectively use an 'engine'.
- To determine if you have a 'fuel' or 'engine' problem, assess if you have quality content and if it's being effectively distributed.
- A growth person focuses on the 'engine': acquiring and converting users, and is data-driven and analytical.
- In Product-Led Growth (PLG) startups, the product itself is the primary marketing tool, and the user is the buyer, making the user experience and a non-linear funnel crucial.
- Product-Led Growth (PLG) is a go-to-market strategy where the product drives customer acquisition, conversion, and expansion, requiring a great product, a free version, and a conversion mechanism.
- The GACC framework (Goals, Audience, Channels, Content) provides a structure for developing a go-to-market strategy.
- An effective marketing team is one that achieves its goals, delivers a return on investment, builds a strong brand, and continuously learns and experiments.

## Grace Isford

- On Go-To-Market: Focus, focus, focus. From the market perspective, companies often want to do a lot and often have horizontal technology platforms that can do a lot. But it is much better to focus and find stability in one area or sub-segment of the customer and then sequence it and do other hills over time. - Grace Isford
- Sell the product: Are you going through a lengthy sales process where you are talking with people who do not have the purse string? Think carefully about whom you are targeting, how your price points, and how your pricing strategy aligns with their budget. - Grace Isford

- 'Sell the alpha, not the feature.'
- The 'mid-market' is a dangerous place for startups; it's better to focus on the upper end of small business or the low end of enterprise.
- Tier-one logos (e.g., Stripe, Tesla) can be the best early adopters because they are motivated to find a competitive edge ('alpha').
- A single $100,000 deal is more valuable than ten $10,000 deals because the larger client is more committed to your success and will provide better feedback.
- When selling to enterprise leaders, focus on 'vision-casting' and selling the opportunity rather than just solving a problem.
- Offering services can be an effective way to initiate relationships with enterprise customers.
