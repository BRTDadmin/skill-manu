# Lenny Strategy Positioning Knowledge Base

Curated insights from 154 Lenny's Podcast episodes.

## Ada Chen Rekhi

- Curiosity loops can be used to make better decisions by gathering contextual advice from a diverse group of people.
- A good question is specific, solicits rationale, and is not biased.
- When asking for advice, make it lightweight for the other person to respond.
- Close the loop with people who gave you advice and let them know how it turned out.

## Adam Grenier

- In a changing market, it's crucial to reassess your product-market fit, as your existing product may no longer meet the market's needs.

## Adriel Frederick

- When entering a market, it is important to understand the existing power structures and anticipate resistance. However, it is equally important to identify and address legitimate criticisms, such as those concerning worker pay and conditions, rather than dismissing all opposition as self-interested.

## Albert Cheng

- Yeah, I think it’s a combination of a few things. One is that you need to have a culture of experimentation. You need to have a culture where it’s okay to fail. The second thing is that you need to have a very clear understanding of what your inputs and outputs are. So for example, at chess.com, our North Star is weekly active users. And then we have a series of input metrics that we think will ladder up to that North Star. So for example, we have the number of games played, we have the number of puzzles played, we have the number of lessons watched. And so we have a team that’s dedicated to each of those input metrics. And then within each of those teams, we have a series of hypotheses that we want to test. And so it’s a combination of having a very clear strategy, having a culture of experimentation, and then having a team that’s dedicated to each of those input metrics.

## Alex Hardiman

- The New York Times's acquisition of Wordle and The Athletic transformed it into a brand capable of being an essential subscription for news and life needs.

## Alex Komoroske

- A disruptive technology changes tons of assumptions you didn’t even realize you had.
- In a world where content is cheap to produce, the value shifts to curation and taste.
- The adjacent possible is about taking small, safe, and reasonable steps that align with a long-term vision.

## Ami Vora

- While strategy is undeniably valuable for guiding direction and setting goals, it’s the execution—the tangible implementation of those plans—that truly drives success. Without strong execution, even the best strategies can’t succeed. This means being willing to get your hands dirty, to tackle the mundane and sometimes tedious aspects of the work that lead to real results. Successful execution allows you to learn from both your triumphs and your setbacks, enabling you to refine and improve your strategy over time.
- Time allotment for strategy vs. execution.
- How to become a better strategic thinker.

## Andrew Wilkinson

- The best businesses have a moat.
- Bootstrapped businesses can become huge. The main difference between bootstrapping and VC is the tolerance for burning money.

- Navigating the Complexities of Three-Way Marketplaces: Lessons from Swiggy
- Prioritizing Customer and Seller Needs in Marketplace Development

## Arielle Jackson

- A strong brand strategy is more important than a perfect name. A bad name won't kill a company with a great product and strategy, but a good name can be a significant advantage.
- The launch of the Square Stand represented a strategic shift to move upmarket from individual sellers to more established retail businesses.

## Meltem Kuran Berkowitz

- The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the trend of remote work, which created a massive tailwind for Deel's business.
- A great product is the foundation of any successful growth strategy. Without it, even the most effective acquisition channels will fail.

## Bangaly Kaba

- Use the “Managing Complex Change” framework to diagnose and solve barriers to change in a given team or area. The framework lays out five things a team needs in order to change: Vision, Skills, Incentives, Resources, Action plan. If you are missing any one of these, you get a different style of negative outcome, instead of the change you want. For example, having everything except vision causes confusion, and having everything except the right incentives causes resistance. Since these negative outcomes can be felt and observed in the team, you can work backward from them to their cause. Once you know the precise cause, you can solve it to unlock change.

## Ben Williams

- Disrupting an established industry requires a deep understanding of the market and a willingness to challenge the status quo.

- Short-term speculative trading is akin to gambling and not a sound investment strategy.
- A great business is one that requires very little new capital to grow, like See's Candies.
- Investing in companies with strong brands and pricing power is a key to long-term success.
- It's crucial to understand the difference between brands that command pricing power (like Heinz) and those that don't (like Kraft cheese).
- Successful investing often comes down to a few high-conviction decisions over a long career.
- The concentration of wealth in a few large tech companies is a natural outcome of human nature and competition.

## Claire Hughes Johnson

- When scaling, you need to think about your internal operating system and structures, not just the product and customer.
- Don't over-index on what you know. Hire for your gaps.
- Have a clear company operating system, including founding documents.

## Cristina Cordova

- The first trait of generational companies is ambition, bordering on ludicrous.
- If a company's thesis is marked by extraordinary ambition, it's probably worth paying attention.
- The second trait of generational companies is that it's all about the founder.
- The third sign is that no one has ever attempted this idea before.
- If the three most important things in real estate are location, location, location, the three most important things in startups are founder, founder, founder.

## Dan Hockenmaier

- A marketplace is a good business because it has network effects, high margins, and is often a winner-take-all market.
- Health metrics for marketplaces include fill rate, market depth, and time to fill.
- When expanding a marketplace, you can expand geographically, by category, or by adding new services.
- Marketplaces can add a SaaS offering, but it's trickier to add a marketplace to a SaaS business.
- There's an opportunity to unbundle a marketplace when there's a lot of fragmentation or when the existing players are not serving a particular niche well.
- The future of marketplaces is in B2B and in more complex services.

## Jules Walter

- The original iPhone's success was rooted in the insight that users value aesthetics as much as functionality.
- Superhuman succeeded by identifying and serving a niche of users who desired a faster, more efficient email experience.
- Uber's creation was made possible by the convergence of widespread smartphone adoption, GPS technology, and reliable digital payment systems.

## David Perell

- It's not always necessary to have a fully-formed strategy from the beginning; sometimes the best approach is to start, experiment, and adapt as you go.
- Focusing on a specific niche and providing high-value content can lead to a successful and profitable business.

## David Singleton

- What are they getting out of the products as they are today and what are the problems adjacent to the ones that we’re already solving for them? And when we find that confluence of kind of need and then adjacency to what we’re already doing, that’s usually our invitation to go and build something new.

## Ed Batista

- No specific points mentioned in the transcript.

## Elena Verna

- In a fast-moving market, it is more effective to be reactive to market trends than to try to create them.
- Success in the AI space is often about being in the right place at the right time, riding a wave of demand rather than creating it.
- It is crucial for companies to stay focused and be disciplined in saying 'no' to distractions to have the biggest impact.

## Elias Torres

## Gustaf Alstromer

- A great business model is crucial for a startup's success. Airbnb had an incredible business model from early on, which made it hard to fail.
- The motivation for starting a company can be diverse: solving a technical problem, proving oneself, changing the world, or just wanting to be successful. The specific motivation doesn't matter as much as its strength and durability.

## Itamar Gilad

- 'Opinion-based development,' where a company goes all-in on an idea based on belief, is extremely risky, as shown by the failure of Google+.
- 'Evidence-guided' development, which emphasizes experimentation, learning from users, and iterating based on data, leads to more successful products like Gmail's tabbed inbox.
- It's more effective to have discussions based on hard data rather than opinions. Data leads to more productive conversations and better decisions.
- The difference between a startup and a big company is in the implementation of evidence-guided principles: startups need to be more disciplined, while big companies need to be more agile.
- Speed of discovery (building the right things) is far more important than speed of delivery (building things fast).

## Ivan Zhao

- Maintain a steadfast commitment to your core vision, but remain adaptable in your implementation and tactics.

## Jessica Lachs

- When defining metrics, it's important to pick the right ones and align incentives accordingly.
- Simplifying metrics can lead to better outcomes.

## Jessica Hische

- A logo refresh is often necessary when a company starts to scale and needs a more versatile and robust brand identity for various applications, such as merchandise, conferences, and new product launches.
- The decision to refresh a logo should be driven by tangible needs, such as improving scalability, fixing legibility issues, or adapting to a company pivot, rather than purely aesthetic desires.

## Jiaona Zhang

- Every company needs to have a big, ambitious vision to inspire and guide the team, even if the path to achieving it is not immediately clear.
- When pursuing a large strategic initiative, it's important to be clear about which phase you are in, whether it's a 'learning phase' to test hypotheses or a 'scaling phase' to drive growth.
- Before committing to a new product idea, it is essential to thoroughly analyze and confirm that the unit economics are sound from the outset.

## John Cutler

- A clear North Star metric is essential for aligning the entire company around a single, shared goal.
- There is no single path to success; companies can achieve their goals in many different ways, and there is always room for improvement.

- Linear's strategy is to build a high-quality, opinionated product that is the best in its niche for software development teams.
- Design and brand are considered key competitive advantages.

## Kayvon Beykpour

- Avoid internal competition between a company's own products. For instance, Twitter's video platforms, Vine and Periscope, competed with each other instead of being seamlessly integrated into the main product, leading to confusion and inefficiencies.
- A standalone live video app for short-form content may not be durable; it needs to be surrounded by asynchronous features to keep the community engaged.

## Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter

- The success of Community Notes is attributed to several key principles: universal access through random selection of contributors, complete transparency, a focus on bridging divides, proving its effectiveness at each stage, and empowering the community to make decisions without company override.
- The adoption of Community Notes by other platforms like Meta indicates its potential to become an industry standard for combating misinformation.
- Radical transparency, by making all code and data public, is a powerful way to build trust.

## Kevin Aluwi

- I am kind of annoyed at how much it's being misused, this term 'super app'. It's really popular in VC-consultant-analyst circles because it sounds really great on a strategy deck because all of the synergies and the lower CAC and the higher retention, all of these things sound great, but in reality, a lot of those benefits don't pan out.
- Why Kevin doesn’t believe in moats as a durable solution, and the value of doing hard things. I'm not a big believer in moats as a durable solution... I think the only real moat is to just be better than your competition. And so for us, that meant doing a lot of the hard things that our competitors weren't willing to do.

## Kevin Weil

- OpenAI’s philosophy of model maximalism—the idea that AI models will improve so quickly that it’s better to build for capabilities that are just emerging rather than extensively scaffolding around current limitations.
- OpenAI embraces an “iterative deployment” approach, preferring to ship products early and refine them in public rather than perfecting them internally.

## Kunal Shah

- Profit pools can provide valuable insights into the values of a country.

- In regions like India where hourly wages are uncommon, the perception of time and its worth differs significantly, which can be a hurdle for time-based transaction businesses.

## Lane Shackleton

- It is important to distinguish between good and bad strategy. Good strategy is a coherent set of analyses, concepts, policies, arguments, and actions that respond to a high-stakes challenge.
- The concept of "Turning the Flywheel" from Jim Collins is a useful model for understanding how momentum is built in a business.

## Laura Modi

- In a crisis, a 'slowth' strategy—deliberately slowing down growth to serve existing customers—can be a powerful long-term strategy for building brand loyalty and trust.
- Challenging the existing narrative and stigma in an industry can be a powerful brand and business strategy. Bobbie's success came from changing the conversation around infant formula.

## Lauryn Isford

- The choice between a trial and a freemium model depends on the complexity of the product and the user's ability to experience value quickly. 
- A self-serve motion can be implemented even in a sales-led organization by providing self-serve options for certain user segments or use cases.

## Lulu Cheng Meservey

- For startups, the enemy is the status quo. Not taking risks allows the status quo to win by default.
- Acknowledge that as an underdog, you cannot play the same game as incumbents who have more resources and relationships.
- Assume you need an approach that doesn't require a lot of money, people, or institutional backing.
- Go direct with your communications rather than relying on traditional media.

## Madhavan Ramanujam

- The 2x2 framework that identifies your optimal pricing model is based on market share and wallet share.
- Why popular AI coding tools may have already doomed themselves with underpricing.

- The single question that reveals if your pricing is too complex: Can your early prospects or customers explain your pricing to others in a simple manner?
- Beautifully simple pricing means coming up with a simple pricing strategy that your customers immediately get and can explain to others.

## Madhavan Ramanujam

## Maggie Crowley

- Strategy is an important but small part of the PM job.
- Maggie’s step-by-step process for writing your product strategy involves understanding the company mission, identifying a customer problem, defining a vision, and then outlining the steps to get there.
- Not every feature needs a deep, complex strategy document. Sometimes a simple one-pager is enough.
- The value of working through the strategy process is not just the final document, but the alignment and clarity it creates for the team.
- Maggie’s one-pager doc is a concise way to communicate the most important aspects of a product strategy.

## Manik Gupta

- Company-product fit is as important as product-market fit. The company's culture, values, and resources must be aligned with the product you are building.

- Embrace your competitors, learn from them, and strive to get better each day.

## Marty Cagan

- A clear product strategy is crucial and must align with the overall business strategy.

## Matt Dixon

- There are three major fears that drive customer indecision:
    1.  Fear of making the right choice, which includes concerns about solution configuration, contract terms, and integration
    2.  Fear of learning something negative after signing a contract, such as discovering unfavorable reviews or rankings post-purchase
    3.  Fear of not realizing the expected ROI, which can lead to reputational damage and even job loss

## Matt LeMay

- In the current economic climate, the threshold for what constitutes a worthwhile business investment is significantly higher.
- Teams and individuals who cannot demonstrate a clear and direct contribution to the company's bottom line are at a greater risk of being eliminated during periods of restructuring or layoffs.

## Matt MacInnis

- The “high alpha, low beta” framework can be used for evaluating people, processes, and products. Alpha is outperformance relative to the index, and beta is volatility. The ideal is high alpha, low beta.
- Processes in a business exist for the sole purpose of lowering beta (decreasing volatility), but the downside is that they suppress alpha. The nuanced dance is lowering beta in areas you need to, without suppressing alpha in the places you need it.

## Megan Cook

- When launching a new product line, adopt a startup mindset. Start small, prove the concept with minimal resources, and use the learnings to inform the broader product portfolio.

## Melissa Perri and Denise Tilles

- It is important to have a clear and well-defined product strategy.
- It is important to align the product strategy with the overall business strategy.
- It is important to continuously monitor and adapt the product strategy as needed.

## Melissa Perri

- At the scale-up phase (from product-market fit to scaling), companies need to rethink their entire strategy and focus on prioritization. This is often the first time a company has to create and deploy a comprehensive, prioritized strategy.
- A common failure mode is having a 'missing middle' where teams are busy working on features, but there's no clear connection between that work and the company's high-level business goals and vision.
- Strategy deployment is the process of connecting the company's vision and strategic intents to the work that product teams are doing.

## Mike Maples, Jr.

- Great startup ideas have three elements: inflections, insights, and founder-future fit.
- Inflections are external shifts that create potential for radical change.
- Insights are a unique understanding of how to harness inflections.
- Founder-future fit is the alignment between the founders and the future they envision.
- Startups win by proposing a radically different future, not by executing better than incumbents.
- Avoid the 'comparison trap' and 'conformity trap'.
- Develop non-consensus and right insights.
- Identify lighthouse customers who have a desperate need for your product.

## Molly Graham

- A clear and compelling strategy is essential for any company that wants to achieve long-term success. It provides a roadmap for the future and helps everyone in the organization make decisions that are aligned with the company's goals.
- Don't be afraid to pivot or change your strategy if it's not working. The most successful companies are those that are able to adapt to changing market conditions.
- Your strategy should be based on a deep understanding of your customers, your competitors, and the market as a whole.

- The 'What is? What could be? What is the ideal bliss?' framework for structuring a persuasive argument.
- The importance of pushing the medium and brand guidelines to create a more pleasing experience for the audience.

## Naomi Gleit

- Don’t outsource your critical thinking. Whether it’s a two-hour brainstorming session or a solitary quiet hour, prioritize time to think about your strategies and decisions.

## Naomi Ionita

- Waiting too long to monetize is a common mistake for startups. Start charging for B2B products as soon as you have early adopters who are getting value.
- Underpricing is another common mistake. It cheapens the product and makes it harder to raise prices later.
- Evernote's failure to bridge from a personal tool to a collaborative tool for businesses limited its growth potential.
- A hybrid pricing model (e.g., seats + usage) is common in SaaS.

## Nickey Skarstad

- To set a successful strategy, you need a clear vision, a set of measurable goals, and a plan for how you're going to achieve them.

## Noam Lovinsky

- Having a broader view of the company strategy and an instinct for what the company should be doing is a superpower for a product leader.

## Oji Udezue and Ezinne Udezue

- Focus on "sharp problems" to avoid the "drunken startup building" walk.
- The way to avoid a drunken startup walk is to pick a sharp problem.

## Paige Costello

- Asana's strategy has evolved from being project-based to pillar-based to create more agency and accountability.

## Patrick Campbell

- Your goals, business model, and funding situation need to be aligned.
- Not all ideas are suitable for VC funding. A VC-fundable business should have the potential to become a billion-dollar company.
- If you don't have a clear path to a billion dollars in annual revenue, you might be better off building a smaller, profitable business.
- To understand your competitors, look at their pricing pages, talk to their former employees, and use data products to see their market share and other metrics.
- Local strategies can be more effective for some companies than trying to compete globally from the start.

## Paul Adams

- The 666 roadmap is a strategic planning tool to balance long-term vision with short-term execution.
- Focus on the long-term vision and how to enact it, rather than getting caught up in short-term predictions.

## Ray Cao

- TikTok's competitive strategy is to maintain high velocity and innovation, metaphorically running the second half of the marathon faster than the first.
- The global expansion strategy relies on localization, including local hiring and cultural adaptation of the product.

## Robby Stein

- Google's strategy is to expand what's possible with search by leveraging AI to answer more complex queries and tap into their extensive information graphs (product graph, places DB).
- The future of content and SEO is to create helpful, high-quality content, as Google's AI systems use the same signals to reward valuable content.

## Roger Martin

- To win in business, you must be either a low-cost provider or differentiated.
- If you’re neither a low-cost provider nor differentiated, competitors can “bully” you and take market share.
- Two questions to determine if you're winning:
    1. Could you match competitor price decreases and remain more profitable than them? (low-cost provider)
    2. Could customers essentially flip a coin between you and a competitor? (differentiated)
- Strategy is a skill that anyone can develop over time with practice.
- Avoid “playing to play” instead of playing to win.

## Ryan Hoover

- Cities can be thought of as products with a feature set (people, weather, activities, culture, food) and a cost (cost of living, housing, food, taxes).
- When deciding whether to serve a niche or a broad market, it depends on the stage of the company. Start with a niche and expand as you grow.
- Have a vision for how you will expand from a niche to a broad market.

## Sam Lessin

- Business strategy should include a focus on building a strong company culture based on trust and respect.
- In a world of technological disruption, a company's reputation and the trustworthiness of its people are significant competitive advantages.

## Sam Schillace

- Frame innovation through 'what-if' questions rather than 'why-not' questions. 'What-if' questions open up possibilities and encourage creative thinking, while 'why-not' questions focus on limitations and obstacles.
- Thinking from first principles allows you to break down complex problems to their fundamental truths and build up solutions from there, rather than being constrained by existing analogies or conventions.
- To have a significant impact, you need to be willing to pursue disruptive ideas that challenge the status quo, even if they are met with initial resistance and skepticism.

## Sean Ellis

- Growth strategies have evolved significantly over the past decade.

## Shaun Clowes

- A data-informed approach is more effective than a purely data-driven one, blending data with intuition and qualitative insights.
- True intuition is the result of the brain's subconscious processing of vast amounts of data and experience over time.

## Shreyas Doshi

- A clear and robust product strategy is the most effective tool for reducing wasted effort and ensuring alignment across the organization.
- Plans themselves are often less valuable than the process of planning, but a good strategy makes the planning process itself more efficient and effective.

## Shreyas Doshi

- A good product strategy consists of a coherent set of testable and falsifiable hypotheses, not just a list of features or a vague mission statement.

## Shweta Shrivastava

- Waymo's long-term vision is to make transportation safer and more accessible for everyone.

## Tanguy Crusson

- When considering new product development, strategically evaluate whether to build, buy, or partner.
- Avoid 'competitive myopia' by being aware of the broader market and not just direct competitors.
- A strong 'why now' is essential for any new initiative to justify its priority over other opportunities.

## Greg Isenberg, Sahil Bloom

- The 'messy middle' is the 99% of the startup journey between the initial idea and the final outcome, and it's where the real work happens. (Greg Isenberg, citing Scott Belsky)

## Timothy Davis

- Your paid growth strategy should be informed by where your users are already finding you organically.
- If a channel is working organically, you can use paid advertising to 'turn the knob up to 11'.
- Use attribution models like 'time decay attribution' to understand the customer journey and the role of different touchpoints.

## Tobi Lütke

- Complexity kills entrepreneurship.
- A 100-year perspective helps optimize for lasting impact over short-term gain.
- Long-term thinking enables better partnership decisions and helps resist value extraction.
- You need both a positional game (long-term strategy) and tactics (short-term wins).

## Tom Conrad

- Understanding the "math formula" of a business is crucial. For Pandora, it was about the cost of music licensing versus the revenue from advertising.
- An excess of investment can be an albatross, leading to poor decision-making.
- Sometimes the best strategic move is to wind down a business and return money to investors, as Pets.com did.

## Tomer Cohen

- The pace of change in the market is accelerating, and companies need to be able to adapt quickly to stay competitive.
- The traditional organizational model is broken and needs to be rethought.
- The 'full-stack builder' model is a strategic response to the changing nature of work and technology.

## Tomer Cohen

- A company's strategy must be built on a foundation of clarity and focus. It is better to commit to a clear path and be wrong than to be confused and hedge your bets, which leads to mediocrity. (Tomer Cohen)
- True strategic priorities are demonstrated through resource allocation. If you claim something is a priority, your best people and resources should be working on it. (Tomer Cohen)
- Frame your strategic goals based on the total potential market and opportunity, not by incrementally building on current numbers. This allows for non-linear, 10X thinking. (Tomer Cohen)

## Upasna Gautam

- A roadmap should be a long-term vision and a living document, not a list of features. It should focus on the outcomes you want to achieve and the "why" behind the work.
- To get buy-in for your roadmap, communicate the vision to stakeholders and get their feedback.
- For a company to be successful, it needs to see itself as a tech company, not just a media company, and have the same challenges and opportunities as other tech companies.

## Uri Levine

- There are two types of startup crises: cash crisis and product-market-fit crisis.
- A cash crisis is when your runway is jeopardized.
- A product-market-fit crisis is when your core value proposition becomes irrelevant.
- To handle a cash crisis, adjust your expenses immediately to extend your runway.
- To handle a product-market-fit crisis, go back to square one and adapt to the new market needs.
- Always be ready for a crisis. The best preparation is having enough runway. 12 to 18 months is a general guideline.
- Don't rely on a regulator.

- A horizontal platform that can be used for a variety of use cases, both digital and non-digital, can be a strong competitive advantage.

## Vijay Iyengar

- If you are the leader in a core product category, you must continue to out-invest everyone else in that core to maintain your advantage. Do not divert resources from the core to chase new ventures.
- When considering expansion, invest profits from the core business into new products rather than reallocating personnel from the core team. This prevents the core from becoming vulnerable.
- Be cautious about entering adjacent product categories. It's easy to get dragged into building a suite of mediocre products that can't compete with best-in-class point solutions and only add marginal revenue while distracting the team.
- If your core product is losing to competitors and your secondary products are not market leaders, it is a strong signal to re-evaluate your strategy and refocus on the core.
- Sunsetting products, especially those that are 'mildly successful', is 10 times more painful than you think. The organizational cost is high, so the decision to launch a new product line must be weighed carefully.

- Rather than pursuing big changes right away, focus on making things “one click better.” Identify the most significant constraints in your strategy and work on refining those elements.
- Be clear on your “why”: When pitching ideas or initiatives, ensure you articulate the reasoning behind them.
- Being strategic means being able to articulate a compelling and simple 'why' behind decisions and the direction of the company, and being a change agent to do things that are hard but in the long-term interest of the product or company.

## Annie Pearl

- The partnership between the CPO and the founder/CEO is critical to a company's success.
- As more companies become product-led, the CPO role is becoming a great training ground for future CEOs.
- A CPO must have a deep understanding of the entire business and its drivers, not just the product organization.
- The CPO is ultimately responsible for delivering business impact, not just shipping features.
- A company's business model (e.g., advertising vs. subscription) fundamentally shapes the product challenges and the levers for growth.

## April Dunford

- Positioning defines how your product is the best in the world at something that a well-defined set of customers cares a lot about.
- If you're not different, you're a commodity and compete on price. It's important to have a differentiator that customers care about.
- Positioning is critical for enterprise software because you're selling to a buying committee with different needs.

## Bob Moesta

- Supply and demand are not independent forces; they influence each other.
- 'Struggling moments' in a customer's life can exist for a long time before a product or service is created to address them.

- Plugging into existing liquid networks (e.g., Thumbtack's Craigslist integration) is a powerful strategy for bootstrapping a marketplace, rather than trying to create a new network from scratch.
- If you don't deeply understand the underlying drivers of your growth, you are always at risk of decline. A business should be analyzed like an onion, constantly peeling back layers to understand it more deeply.

## Brie Wolfson

- A company's reputation should be a reflection of its reality. The goal is to close the gap between the two.
- The most successful companies are not just focused on building great products; they are driven by a desire to be a great company.

## Casey Winters

- It's important to have a clear and well-defined product strategy that is aligned with the overall business strategy.

- While having a high bar for new projects can focus efforts on high-impact initiatives, it also carries the risk of missing out on emerging trends that may not initially meet that bar.

## Chetan Puttagunta

- The sales cycle for AI apps is much shorter than the sales cycle of SaaS.

## Dan Shipper

- The rise of AI may lead to the reshoring of jobs to the U.S., as AI tools can make domestic workers more competitive with offshore labor.

## Richard Rumelt

- Strategy is not about goals, ambitions, visions, missions, or values; it's about what you'll do in response to a challenge.
- A good strategy has a kernel: a diagnosis of the challenge, a guiding policy for the approach, and a set of coherent actions.
- Bad strategy often stems from a weak diagnosis or confusing goals with strategy.
- The 'crux' of a problem is its hardest part; identifying and solving it is key to a successful strategy.
- Power, which can come from asymmetry, reputation, leverage, growth, or specialized knowledge, is essential for a competitive advantage.
- Historical knowledge is a valuable tool for strategists, providing a laboratory of what has and hasn't worked.
- An 'action agenda' is a more effective term for strategy, emphasizing a specific, coherent, and focused list of actions.
- Organizations need a single 'decider' to avoid the indecisiveness of committees.
- Startups should focus on dominating a niche market before expanding.
- The 'value denials' exercise, where you challenge your company's core values, can spark innovation.

## Ronny Kohavi

- Organizations should have a portfolio of experiments, including high-risk, high-reward ideas that have the potential for large payoffs.

## Ryan Singer

- Instead of asking “How long will this take?”, the central question in Shape Up is “How much time is this worth?”, which fundamentally shifts the conversation from estimation to value-based investment.
- If a project is not on track to be completed within its allocated time budget (appetite), the default action is to descale the project or bring it back to the shaping table, rather than extending the deadline.

## Seth Godin

- Four critical strategic choices:
    1.  Choose your customers: Be specific about who you’re serving.
    2.  Choose your competition: The space you operate in creates boundaries.
    3.  Choose your source of validation: Be clear about whose feedback matters.
    4.  Choose your distribution: Your distribution strategy shapes everything.
- Great strategies are centered around tension, not stress. Tension creates curiosity and excitement.
- When launching a product, make sure it promises something people want, but don’t fully deliver until they’ve committed. Create that moment where people are unsure if the promise will be kept—that is where engagement happens.

## Uri Levine

- When a crisis strikes, categorize it and act quickly.
- Don't rely on a single customer or revenue stream.
