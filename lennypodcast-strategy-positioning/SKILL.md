# Lenny's Strategy & Positioning Playbook

Curated strategy insights from 154 Lenny's Podcast episodes featuring strategists from McKinsey, top VCs, and successful founders.

## Core Principles

### Competitive Positioning
- **Category design**: Don't compete in existing categories—create and own new ones.
- **The bar test** (April Dunford): If you can't explain your positioning in a noisy bar, it's too complex.
- **Differentiation through taste**: In commoditized markets, taste and unique perspective become differentiators.

### Strategic Decision-Making
- **Two-way vs. one-way door decisions**: Reversible decisions should be made quickly; irreversible ones deserve more deliberation.
- **Colin Powell's 40-70 Rule**: Make decisions with 40-70% of the information you wish you had.
- **Single decisive reason**: The best decisions often hinge on one compelling reason, not a list of pros and cons.

### Market Analysis
- **Crossing the Chasm**: Understand where you are in the technology adoption lifecycle.
- **Hunters and the hunted**: Know whether you're disrupting or being disrupted.
- **Adjacent markets**: Expand strategically into markets where you have unfair advantages.

### Pricing Strategy
- **Monetizing Innovation** (Madhavan Ramanujam): Design products around price, not price around products.
- **Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity**: Test price sensitivity before launch.
- **Value-based pricing**: Price based on value delivered, not cost to produce.

### Strategic Frameworks
- **Good strategy vs. bad strategy** (Richard Rumelt): Good strategy has a kernel: diagnosis, guiding policy, coherent actions.
- **Strategy Choice Cascade**: Where to play, how to win, capabilities needed.
- **Inflections**: Identify technological or market shifts that create strategic opportunities.
