# Lenny's Product Management Playbook

Curated product management insights from 196 Lenny's Podcast episodes featuring world-class PMs from Stripe, Airbnb, Meta, Netflix, Spotify, and more.

## Core Principles

### Product Discovery
- **Understand before executing**: Do "understand work" before building. Invest time in data instrumentation, analysis, and user conversations. Going slow upfront leads to higher experiment win rates.
- **Voice of customer**: Bring the literal voice of the customer into product conversations through customer advisory councils and direct user research.
- **Adjacent possible**: Focus on small, actionable steps within reach. Define a clear North Star, then identify incremental steps toward it.

### Prioritization Frameworks
- **4BB Framework** (Anuj Rathi): Categorize work into Brilliant Basics, Bread and Butter, Big Bets, and Breaking Bad.
- **Pre-mortems** (Annie Duke): Before starting, imagine failure and set kill criteria. Commit to reassess if red flags appear.
- **Hill climbing** (Ami Vora): Recognize that reaching global optimum requires leaving local peaks and traversing valleys.

### Strategy & Vision
- **Strategy changes behavior**: The goal of a strategy is to change the team's behavior, not just document direction.
- **Perceived simplicity**: Even if underlying technology is complex, user experience should be simple and intuitive.
- **Gardener vs. builder mindset**: Builders plan meticulously; gardeners allow for unexpected breakthroughs.

### Execution Excellence
- **End every meeting with 3 questions** (Alisa Cohn): What did we decide? Who does what by when? Who else needs to know?
- **De-risk meetings**: Pre-socialize ideas with stakeholders before formal meetings.
- **Managing Complex Change framework**: Teams need Vision, Skills, Incentives, Resources, and Action Plan. Missing any causes specific failure modes.

### Metrics & OKRs
- **North Star + input metrics**: Define one North Star (e.g., weekly active users) with input metrics that ladder up to it.
- **Quantify non-sexy work**: Justify tech debt and bug fixes by quantifying impact on performance, costs, or satisfaction.
- **Culture of experimentation**: Create an environment where it's okay to fail and learn.
