# Lenny Product Management Knowledge Base

Curated insights from 196 Lenny's Podcast episodes.

## Ada Chen Rekhi

- Customer advisory councils can be used to get feedback on product conflicts.
- It's important to bring the literal voice of the customer into product conversations.
- User research for your life: don't do what people tell you to do, take it as an input and then make your own decision.

## Adam Grenier

- The "Yes, and..." principle from improv is a valuable tool in product management for building upon ideas and fostering a collaborative environment.
- The "gift of details," another concept from improv, is essential for effective product marketing and creating clear, compelling positioning.

## Adriel Frederick

- R&D or innovation teams must be deeply integrated with the company's core mission to avoid being perceived as a detached, non-essential cost center, which can lead to 'organ rejection' by the rest of the organization.
- The successes of an R&D team should be framed as wins for the entire company, and innovation should be encouraged across all teams, not just siloed within the R&D group.
- Empathy and organizational skills are two of the most critical abilities for a product manager to cultivate.
- When evaluating criticism, it's crucial to distinguish between valid feedback and resistance from incumbent powers whose business models are being disrupted.

## Albert Cheng

- Yeah, I think it’s a combination of a few things. One is that you need to have a culture of experimentation. You need to have a culture where it’s okay to fail. The second thing is that you need to have a very clear understanding of what your inputs and outputs are. So for example, at chess.com, our North Star is weekly active users. And then we have a series of input metrics that we think will ladder up to that North Star. So for example, we have the number of games played, we have the number of puzzles played, we have the number of lessons watched. And so we have a team that’s dedicated to each of those input metrics. And then within each of those teams, we have a series of hypotheses that we want to test. And so it’s a combination of having a very clear strategy, having a culture of experimentation, and then having a team that’s dedicated to each of those input metrics.

## Alex Hardiman

- Wartime product management requires incredible humility to diagnose what is happening on the platform.
- The New York Times shifted from a print-first to a mobile-first product, starting with small mobile use cases and then leading with mobile on everything.
- The New York Times shifted to a direct-to-consumer subscription model in 2011, which was a big nervous bet at the time.
- The New York Times is becoming an essential subscription that meets people's most important news and life needs across news, games, audio, cooking, etc.
- The future of The New York Times is a connected family of products that can meet many different needs, anchored in news but stretched into other facets of life.

## Alex Komoroske

- Embrace a gardener’s mindset instead of a builder’s: While builders meticulously plan every step to achieve a specific goal, this structured approach can stifle unexpected, innovative breakthroughs.
- Focus on the adjacent possible—the small, actionable steps within your reach. Start by defining a clear North Star: a long-term goal that everyone can agree is plausible and exciting. Then, identify the next incremental step that aligns with this vision.
- Treat AI tools as your brainstorming buddy. When you’re wrestling with a concept, dump your thoughts into the tool. Ask it for examples, critiques, or different angles to explore.
- LLMs make writing shitty software significantly cheaper, not necessarily good software, but good enough software.
- In the age of AI, taste is incredibly important. You stand out by having good taste. Taste is about differentiating from what the LLM would have written if given the same prompt.
- The builder mindset can't create more value than the effort put into it. The gardener mindset allows for things to grow on their own, which can create disproportionate value.

## Alisa Cohn

- End every meeting by answering three key questions: What did we decide here? (Go around the room to ensure alignment), Who needs to do what by when? (Clear action items with owners and deadlines), and Who else needs to know? (Communication plan for decisions).

## Ami Vora

- Execution eats strategy for breakfast: The tangible implementation of plans is what truly drives success.
- When handling high-stakes product reviews with executives (who are so inundated with information that they can't go deep on all of it, aka "dinosaur brain"), focus on distilling complex information into concise, actionable recommendations. By doing so, you not only clarify your recommendation but also empower execs to offer useful context, patterns, or insights at the right altitude.
- Use the "hill climb" metaphor to remind your team that moving from a local to a global optimum is like traversing hills and valleys. Imagine your product roadmap like climbing a mountain range, with your current solution being a local peak. Reaching the global optimum or the summit requires leaving your comfortable vantage on an arduous journey to explore other hills and valleys. Trying to play it safe by staying put means forfeiting your shot at reaching the global maximum. Use this analogy to remind your team that achieving the best outcome demands risk-taking and perseverance through challenges. Embrace these hurdles as crucial steps toward success, knowing each stride brings you closer to the summit.
- The goal of a strategy is to change the team's behavior.
- Use metaphors and imagery to communicate your vision and create a shared narrative.

## Amjad Masad

- Use AI-powered platforms for quick prototyping. For example, a sales engineer can rapidly spin up applications to showcase how your product works with APIs or other integrations. This gives clients and teams tangible demos that can drive faster decisions and align expectations.
- Keep things simple at the start. Whether you’re building a product or creating a tool, use minimalist prompts to get the ball rolling. You can always iterate and refine based on feedback—it’s better to start with something that works and improve over time than to over-engineer from the start.

## Andrew Wilkinson

- The best product ideas often come from unsexy, boring industries that are overlooked by others.
- A key to success is finding a niche where you have an unfair advantage.
- Your unique Venn diagram of skills and experience can point you to the right product to build.
- Don't try to build a huge, complex product from day one. Start with something small and manageable to get an initial win.

## Andy Johns

- N/A

## Annie Duke

- Use pre-mortems to set kill criteria. Before starting a project, imagine failure and what early warning signs might have predicted it. Commit in advance to reassess or pivot if you notice those red flags later on. This makes it easier to walk away when sunk costs and overconfidence bias loom large.

## Anuj Rathi

- The Working Backwards framework provides a structured approach to product development, ensuring that products align with customer needs and goals.
- A successful product manager should be a full-stack thinker, considering the entire outcome of their products and possessing a diverse range of skills and experiences.
- The 4BB framework helps prioritize product development efforts into four categories: Brilliant Basics, Bread and Butter, Big Bets, and Breaking Bad, enabling effective allocation of resources.
- Mastering Product Management: The Keys to Success
- The Evolution of Product Management in India

## Arielle Jackson

- The initial positioning for the Square Stand targeted brick-and-mortar businesses, particularly quick-service restaurants and coffee shops, to expand beyond the initial market of mobile vendors.
- The key differentiator for the Square Stand was its unified, all-in-one experience that was more affordable and elegant than traditional POS systems.
- It's possible to launch a successful hardware product without a dedicated product manager, as was the case with the Square Stand, where the hardware team led the launch.

## Meltem Kuran Berkowitz

- Acquisition channels are useless without a great product. Focus on building a product that users love and that solves a real problem.
- A fast-loading website is crucial for a good user experience and for the success of any paid advertising campaigns.

## Bangaly Kaba

- Before executing on a product idea, do “understand work” to truly understand pain points, alternatives, and, ultimately, the best opportunities. Too often, teams have an idea, find some data to justify it, and then start executing. And too often, this leads to failed experiments. Instead, invest time up front in understanding what is happening through things like data instrumentation, data analysis, or talking to users. This translates to “going slow to go fast” because the up-front investment will turn into much higher experiment win rates, especially as lessons compound over time.
- Use the “Managing Complex Change” framework to diagnose and solve barriers to change in a given team or area. The framework lays out five things a team needs in order to change: Vision, Skills, Incentives, Resources, Action plan. If you are missing any one of these, you get a different style of negative outcome, instead of the change you want. For example, having everything except vision causes confusion, and having everything except the right incentives causes resistance. Since these negative outcomes can be felt and observed in the team, you can work backward from them to their cause. Once you know the precise cause, you can solve it to unlock change.

## Ben Williams

- A 'depth-first' approach is crucial when entering a new market, focusing on a single persona, context, and use case initially.
- A command-line tool can be a powerful way to engage developers.
- A 'decision science' team can help guide focus and investment by analyzing qualitative and quantitative data.
- When deciding on free vs. paid features, consider the value to the user and the path to monetization. Freemium can be a powerful GTM strategy.
- Activation milestones are key to understanding user engagement and driving adoption.

## Brad Feld

- The only thing that matters is the product, everything else will take care of itself is a common, but incorrect, belief.
- Three things matter in a company: the product, the customer, and the company itself.
- A common weakness in companies as they scale (around $5-10 million ARR) is that the CEO's initial strength can become a weakness for the business. For example, a product-focused CEO might continue to spend too much time in the product for too long.

## Casey Winters

- To effectively communicate upwards, understand the motivations and context of your audience (executives). Frame your ideas in a way that aligns with their goals and priorities.
- De-risk meetings by pre-socializing your ideas with key stakeholders. This helps you get feedback early and build consensus before the meeting.
- Proper meeting preparation involves not just creating a presentation, but also anticipating questions and objections, and having data to support your claims.
- 'Perceived simplicity' is a key goal for product development. Even if the underlying technology is complex, the user experience should be simple and intuitive.
- To justify 'non-sexy' product improvements (e.g., tech debt, bug fixes), you need to quantify their impact on the business, such as improved performance, reduced costs, or increased customer satisfaction.
- The Chief Product Officer (CPO) role is about setting the product vision and strategy for the entire company, and ensuring that the product organization is executing effectively.
- There is a spectrum of product people, from those who are more technical to those who are more business-oriented. The best product people have a mix of both skills.
- To level up your skills, you need to be constantly learning and seeking out new challenges. This can involve reading books, attending conferences, and working on side projects.

## Chamath Palihapitiya

- It is crucial for product managers to define the responsibilities of algorithms in algorithm-heavy products, as algorithms lack understanding of long-term effects and user intent.
- The best CEOs possess a high degree of mental agility and integrity, which are key indicators of their potential for success.

## Charlie Munger

- When evaluating a company, it's important to understand the underlying business and not just gamble on price fluctuations.
- A key to a successful product is having a strong brand that people trust, which can take a long time to build.
- Some products, like Heinz ketchup, have a unique flavor profile that creates brand loyalty and pricing power.

## Claire Hughes Johnson

- If you're not sure who the decision-maker is, it's probably you. Act on that to avoid slowing down the company.
- Follow a process, get things done, and make a decision. If you're worried you're not the decision-maker, just ask. Don't get stuck.
- Look around the corner to see what's coming next and what needs to be put in place now to avoid a crisis in six months. This is a key to scaling.
- At Stripe, they famously didn't have product managers in the early days. The idea was that everyone was a product manager.

## Conor Grennan

- The use case model of teaching technology is not always effective, especially for new technologies like AI that require a behavioral shift.

## Cristina Cordova

- The bulk of the vision was there in that beta period from 2013 to 2014, but still awaiting refinement. This suggests the importance of having a strong initial product vision, even in beta.
- So even if the product is great, it may have to radically change anyway. This highlights the iterative nature of product development.
- Instead of judging the product, judge the mission. This suggests focusing on the long-term vision rather than the current state of the product.
- Special companies have a crisp articulation of how future systems should look and feel, emphasizing the importance of a clear product vision.

## Dan Hockenmaier

- A growth model is an analytical representation of how a business grows. It's a formula for your business's growth.
- The core building blocks of a growth model for a SaaS business are acquisition, retention, and monetization.
- For a transactional business, you also need to model the transaction frequency and average order value.
- For a marketplace, you need to model both the supply and demand sides and how they interact.
- It's important to have a high-level conceptual model of the business and then more detailed models for each team or area of the business.
- Teams should have their own North Star metric and a model of the inputs that drive it.

## Jules Walter

- Product sense is a learned skill, not an innate talent; it can be trained like a muscle.
- Product sense is the ability to consistently create products or product changes that achieve the desired user impact.
- Building product sense requires deep user empathy and the creativity to devise effective solutions for user needs.
- Deconstruct everyday products to understand their design choices and identify UX best practices.
- When analyzing products, ask: What is the job-to-be-done? How does the app explain its value? How easy is it to use? How does it make the user feel? What are its strengths and weaknesses?
- Comparing products within the same category helps to highlight and understand specific design decisions.
- Reframing a problem can unlock more creative and effective solutions, such as focusing on making a wait feel shorter rather than just reducing the wait time.

## David Perell

- It's better to answer one question well than to provide a large amount of content that people don't have time to consume.

## David Singleton

- The way we think about product development at Stripe, it really is to find the correct set of early users to kind of co-create the product with. When we got to starting the Stripe billing product, we realized that there were a number of our existing users, these were companies like Figma and Slack, were already using Stripe for payments, but had these subscriptions business models. And we figured that there were going to be many more of these kind of companies in the future. And we could see that they were really kind of pushing the boundaries of what was possible here. So we decided to co-create the product with them. So we had shared Slack channels, we’d actually show them product on a very regular basis, get their feedback on it. And only when that original kind of Alpha group was super, super happy with the product did we then think it might be ready to go to a broader audience. So that is just how we build product at Stripe.
- And that means that every engineer building product at Stripe really has many of the kind of attributes and will exercise many of the attributes that’ll you often find in PMs in other companies.
- We try to put people into an environment which is as close to the real job as possible. So for instance, when we’re hiring engineers, we don’t do whiteboard coding. It’s actually kind of pair programming welcome to use Google to search for Stack Overflow to search for answers. We don’t really mind. And we’ve created these exercises that is close to real problems as we need to solve at Stripe as possible. The same is true for PMs. One of the things, for instance we do with PMs is we have a written exercise, we’ve got obviously a variety of different other kinds of exercises too. But the written exercise is really to kind of test for clarity of thought and the ability to express that in writing, which is a very important skill at Stripe.

## Deborah Liu

- The most important skill for a product leader is to fall in love with the problem, not the solution. A deep understanding of the use case and the problem you are trying to solve is essential.
- Curiosity is a more valuable trait for a product manager than mastery of a specific playbook or framework. A willingness to learn and adapt is key.
- When interviewing for a product manager role, passion for the product and a deep understanding of the user are more important than knowing how to write a spec or a PRD.
- The core of a product manager's job is to 'write down what you want to build, and then you work with the engineers to do it.'

## Ed Batista

- No specific points mentioned in the transcript.

## Elena Verna

- In the current AI-driven market, companies must re-discover product-market fit every three months due to the rapid pace of change.
- The standard for new products has shifted from Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to Minimum Lovable Product (MLP).
- Activation is no longer a responsibility of the growth team but has shifted to the product team, focusing on a continuous, exploratory process rather than a linear onboarding flow.
- The user journey is no longer a linear funnel but a complex web, requiring a systems-thinking approach to growth centered on interconnected loops.

## Elias Torres

- Build for time to value, not immediate revenue - focus on creating a product that customers are obsessed with before monetizing.
- Many founders are delusional about their product's success, even with significant revenue. The focus should be on building something people are willing to throw money at.
- At HubSpot, it took a long time for customers to see value (building blogs, SEO ranking, etc.). At Drift, the focus was on shortening the time to value.
- When you have 5,000 customers, you can’t just edit code and reload. You need to learn to scale. This involves rebuilding the team, product, and trust with customers.

## Elizabeth Yin

- You have found product/market fit when you can repeatably acquire customers for a lower cost than what they are worth to you.

## Esther Crawford

- Outdated and bespoke infrastructure can significantly slow down product development.
- A company culture that avoids firing poor performers can weigh everyone down.
- A strong product vision and the ability to cut through bureaucracy are essential for effective product leadership.
- Product decisions should not be made by polling social media or asking friends, but by relying on the expertise of the product team.

## Ethan Evans

- Invention is the easy part. The expression and execution of an idea is much more difficult. What matters is bringing an idea to life and iterating it over and over again, so that its value to users increases over time.
- Being right is good, but being quick is necessary. Amazon can ship fast and stay ahead of the competition by prioritizing speed—even if that means gambling on an outcome.

## Ethan Mollick

- The lack of good business benchmarks for AI is a critical problem.
- Companies should develop their own internal benchmarks to evaluate AI performance on their specific tasks.

## Flo Crivello

- Most 'AI agents' in production are better described as intelligent workflows with a human-designed structure.
- The practical value of AI Agents is becoming undeniable for use cases across customer service, sales, recruiting, inbox management, scheduling, and information synthesis.

## Gayle Laakmann McDowell

- The ability to solve unfamiliar problems and communicate the solution is a key skill for Product Managers, and is what is being tested in case interviews.

## Gib Biddle

- The DHM model (Delight customers in Hard-to-copy, Margin-enhancing ways) is a product strategy framework.
- A/B testing is crucial for understanding the real impact of new features, as shown by Netflix's 'perfect new release' test.
- You can start building your product strategy muscle even in the first two weeks of a new role.

## Guillermo Rauch

- Product managers can become more full-stack by learning to prototype and ship to production, enabling them to build and iterate on ideas more quickly.
- Developing taste as a product manager is a skill that can be cultivated by increasing 'exposure hours' to how people use your products and other products in the market.

## Gustaf Alstromer

- The most common reason startups fail is that they don't talk to users, which means they don't find product-market fit.
- 'Make things people want' is the most important principle.
- It's all about talking to customers and learning that you're building something that's actually useful.
- At YC, the main question asked to founders is 'what's holding you back from moving faster?' to crystallize priorities.
- Startups should focus on doing things that don't scale at the beginning.

## Itamar Gilad

- GIST (Goals, Ideas, Steps, Tasks) is a framework for product planning and execution that connects high-level goals to daily tasks.
- The Value Exchange Loop helps set better goals by focusing on creating user value and capturing business value.
- A North Star Metric is a single metric representing the core value provided to users, while KPIs are tactical metrics to track progress towards goals.
- The ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) framework is used for prioritizing ideas, but it's a subjective tool for conversation, not a scientific formula.
- The Confidence Meter is a tool to track and visualize the evolution of confidence in ideas over time as more evidence is gathered.
- Traditional feature-based roadmaps are broken; instead, roadmaps should be based on goals, learning, and outcomes (like the GIST framework).
- OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are a great tool for setting ambitious and public goals, implementing the 'G' in GIST.
- The Product Manager is not the 'CEO of the product' but rather a 'janitor' or servant leader who enables the team to do their best work.
- 'Plan and execute' is a risky, opinion-based approach; 'evidence-guided' development, which involves continuous learning and validation, is superior.
- Speed of discovery (learning and validating ideas) is more important than speed of delivery (shipping features).
- To become more evidence-guided, start by admitting there's a problem, start small with one team or project, be patient, and celebrate successes.

## Ivan Zhao

- Hide your vision behind something people want, a concept Ivan calls 'sugar-coating the broccoli'.
- The initial version of Notion was overly complex; the product's success came from simplifying the user experience in its reboot.
- When building a horizontal product, start with a clear and compelling use case that has broad distribution potential, like documents and notes.
- Strike a balance between providing foundational capabilities ('Lego bricks') and packaged solutions ('Lego boxes').
- Recognize that different user segments will require varying levels of guidance and pre-built solutions.
- The first iteration of Notion was more like a programming language and too abstract for the average user.
- The team realized they needed to mask their ambitious vision of 'everyone can create their software' within a familiar format like documents and wikis.
- It took two years for the team to pivot and realize they needed to build a productivity tool.
- It's crucial to understand that the majority of users are not developers or designers; they are primarily concerned with what a tool can do for them.
- The initial version of Notion was built to Ivan's personal preferences, not the needs of the users.
- The product's successful reboot was a result of incorporating user feedback and simplifying the overall experience.
- The most significant lesson learned was the importance of solving a real user need.
- A successful strategy is to make the product simple initially and then gradually introduce more advanced features over time.

## Jeff Weinstein

- The power of customer obsession and how to operationalize it in the product development process.
- How to pick the right metrics and use them to drive impact.
- Techniques for getting things done at big companies.
- A group practice Jeff started to uplevel product craft, called Study Group.
- Before focusing on craft, experience, or quality, you need to ensure that you’re solving a burning problem for someone.
- Ask customers to describe what a ‘bad day’ looks like when using your product, and then find ways to track metrics around those frustrations.
- Stripe uses ‘study groups’ to get participants in the mindset of customers, thereby gaining fresh insights into product usability and customer experience.

## Jen Abel

- Founder-led sales is crucial for early-stage product development as it provides direct feedback from the market.
- The insights gained from early sales conversations can and should directly influence the product roadmap.
- "Budding insights" from sales calls are crucial for product development.

## Jeremy Henrickson

- The case against MVPs: Instead of building a minimal viable product, design for the most complex use case first. This forces you to think through all the potential issues and build a more robust system from the start.
- A model for building products: Start with a single, entrepreneurial engineer. Have them spend a few months getting to know the platform. Then, give them a small team and a clear mission.
- Why product leaders need to be right: In a startup, you don't have time to be wrong. You need to have strong opinions, weakly held, and be able to make decisions quickly.
- The differences between building product at Rippling and Coinbase: Rippling is a "compound startup," meaning it's building multiple products at once. This requires a different approach to product development than a company that's focused on a single product.

## Jessica Lachs

- While average metrics are important, it’s crucial to also focus on edge cases and fail states. These rare but significant instances, like DoorDash’s “never delivered” orders, can have profound negative impacts despite their infrequency.
- DoorDash converts metrics into a “common currency” to make better decisions, faster, about what to prioritize. They quantify business levers (e.g. price, selection, quality) in terms of their impact on a common metric like gross order value (GOV).
- Once you understand how different metrics impact the “common currency,” you can understand the tradeoffs between different actions more accurately and prioritize more quickly for maximum impact.
- Analytics is about driving business impact, not just providing a service to other functions when requested. Data teams should be involved in decision-making alongside engineering and product. They should not only surface insights about what is happening in the data but should have a point of view on what to do about it.

## Jessica Hische

- A flashy brand won’t save a product that lacks substance. Focus on building something meaningful first. If your product doesn’t solve a real problem or bring value, no amount of branding will make it work.

## Jessica Livingston

- Good founders respond to questions with open-mindedness and they educate people.
- The first idea isn’t always the right idea, you have to be open-minded and maybe adjust.

## Jiaona Zhang

- Build a 'minimum lovable product' (MLP) instead of a minimum viable product (MVP) by focusing on what makes the product lovable and creating a strong emotional connection with users.
- Create better roadmaps through storytelling, weaving a narrative that explains where the product is going and why, which helps to get the team and stakeholders excited and aligned.
- Design crisp and ambitious OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to set clear goals and drive the team to achieve more than they thought possible.
- Avoid the common mistake of jumping to solutions; instead, first, deeply understand the user's problems and the underlying opportunities.
- A product manager's role is not to be the CEO but to influence without authority by understanding opportunities and synthesizing different possibilities into a coherent strategy.
- When executing on a big vision, break it down into smaller, manageable phases (e.g., a learning phase) and be explicit with the team about the goals of each phase.
- Define clear success metrics and milestones for each phase of a project, with explicit go/no-go decision points to avoid the sunk cost fallacy.
- To effectively push back on a founder's idea, first understand their conviction and the 'why' behind it, then present a better, data-backed solution that still achieves their ultimate goal.
- The 'jobs-to-be-done' of a roadmap is to tell a compelling story of where you're going and why, which serves as a powerful tool for alignment and motivation.
- Prioritization should be a direct output of the story you are telling with your roadmap, ensuring that every decision supports the overarching narrative.

## John Cutler

- The top 1% of product teams have a shared understanding of what they're doing and why, connecting their work to customer and business value.
- High-performing teams have a high degree of psychological safety, enabling healthy debates and discussions.
- Effective teams are data-informed, not data-driven, using data to inform their decisions rather than blindly following it.
- Frameworks should be used to facilitate conversations and shared understanding, not as rigid processes to be followed.
- Product sense involves understanding the entire system and how all the different parts interact with each other.
- A product mindset is characterized by curiosity, a focus on the customer, and an orientation towards outcomes.

## John Mark Nickels

- To improve vision and strategy skills, immerse yourself deeply in your domain for an extended period.
- Challenge the status quo by asking, “Why are things the way they are?”
- Set aside quiet time to think about what the world will look like in 5 or 10 years.
- Once you have a solid vision, share it with your team and engage in collaborative brainstorming.

## Jonathan Becker

- Paid acquisition is most effective for products with a high Lifetime Value (LTV) and a fast time to value.

## Julia Schottenstein

- How to identify whether or not you have product-market fit
- Why Julia lives by “worse is better” and “tech debt is a champagne problem”
- The importance of shipping, learning, and iterating
- What PMs can learn from investors

## Julian Shapiro

- Rethink your product feature roadmap to prioritize features that facilitate product-led acquisition, such as settling debts or introducing chat within the product, as these functionalities can lead to explosive growth.

## Julie Zhuo

- The “diagnose with data, treat with design” framework is for balancing gut and data.
- Data is not a tool that is going to tell you what you should do, but it can help you diagnose problems.
- Hypergrowth AI companies often have terrible data infrastructure, but it does not matter in the early stages because they are getting by on good instincts and vibes.

## Karri Saarinen

- Linear has only one PM, the Head of Product, who focuses on the overall product direction rather than day-to-day feature management.
- The company prioritizes craft and user experience over traditional metrics, and does not use A/B testing or metric-based goals.
- New features are launched early to a small group of customers (1-10) for feedback and iteration before a general release.
- Linear uses a flexible, sprint-like development process called "cycles".
- The company advocates for building "opinionated software" that has a strong point of view on how work should be done.
- Engineers and designers are given significant ownership and autonomy to make product decisions.

## Kayvon Beykpour

- Treat 'sacred cows' (deeply ingrained assumptions about a product) as a built-in roadmap for innovation and testing.
- While frameworks like Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) can be valuable, rigid adherence can lead to tunnel vision. Successful decision-making requires a blend of framework-guided analysis and intuitive judgment.
- When copying ideas, the main focus should be on what is right for the customer. It can be done in good or poor taste. For example, Twitter took inspiration from Clubhouse for Spaces but added its own spin and prioritized it as a company-wide initiative.

## Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter

- Ultra-fast, high-impact product teams can be run without traditional tools like OKRs and Jira, using simpler solutions like a single Google Doc.
- For small, focused teams, it's important to start with the minimal necessary roles, such as ML, frontend, backend, design, and research.
- The 'thermal project' approach was mentioned as a way to manage projects.

## Kevin Aluwi

- The insight that we got here was that there kind of needs to be a unifying concept across all of your services... And for us, the way that our customers thought about us was that they thought about the driver.
- I think when we switch to making it really clear that who was the decider for any kind of product development process, I think our execution definitely improved significantly.

## Kevin Weil

- Writing effective evals (AI evaluation tests) is becoming a critical skill for product managers. These structured tests measure model performance on specific tasks, helping teams understand where models excel versus where they struggle. This knowledge fundamentally shapes product design decisions. The quality of evals effectively caps the potential of AI products, as models can only be optimized for what you can measure well.
- OpenAI embraces an “iterative deployment” approach, preferring to ship products early and refine them in public rather than perfecting them internally. This collaborative evolution with users acknowledges that everyone is learning about model capabilities together.
- OpenAI's approach to roadmapping involves setting directional alignment but expecting plans to change as technology evolves, focusing on the planning process rather than rigidly following the plan itself.

## Kevin Yien

- Great PMs need to be great writers. Writing is “clarity at scale,” and a key component of a PM’s job is creating clarity both internally and externally.
- Keep a decision log to improve your product sense. Each entry should include the date, the decision made, the rationale behind it, and any expected outcomes. Revisit every three to six months to evaluate the outcomes.
- Aspiring PMs should start in engineering, design, or sales.

## Kunal Shah

- The Delta 4 framework: for a consumer product to have a chance at gaining traction, it must be at least four points superior to current solutions on a 1-10 scale.

## Lane Shackleton

- Great product managers focus on the "why" behind the work, not just the "what".
- Coda uses a simplified 5-level career ladder (Apprentice, Maker, Leader, Manager, Principal) that is consistent across different roles like product and design, focusing on principles rather than rigid levels.
- OKRs should be seen as the "what" while strategy is the "why". There is a fine line between them, and it is important to understand the distinction.
- The "two-way write-up" is a ritual at Coda where both the presenter and the audience write down their thoughts before a meeting to ensure everyone is prepared and engaged.
- "Learn by making, not talking" is a key principle at Coda, emphasizing the importance of building and iterating over theoretical discussions.
- The "Catalyst" role at Coda is a rotating role responsible for driving specific initiatives and bringing fresh perspectives.
- "Dory and Pulse" are tools used at Coda for collecting feedback and gauging team sentiment.

## Laura Modi

- In a marketplace business like Airbnb, it's crucial to recognize that the 'supply' (the hosts) is the product, not just the technology platform. This understanding should drive the product roadmap and priorities.
- Shifting focus from purely driving metrics (like bookings) to building tools that empower and support the core user base (the hosts) can be a pivotal and beneficial change in product strategy.

## Lauryn Isford

- Onboarding is one of the biggest and most undervalued growth levers. 
- A 20% increase in activation rate was achieved at Airtable by overhauling the onboarding process, which included guided onboarding, personalization, and ongoing education. 
- Airtable’s activation metric evolved from a single-player metric to a multi-player metric (multi-user collaboration) to better align with long-term retention. 
- It is important to define and operationalize activation metrics clearly across the company. 
- A North Star metric should be given enough time (e.g., a year) to determine its impact before considering a change. 
- User education should be prioritized over pushing users to premium features during onboarding. 
- Guardrail metrics are crucial to monitor and prevent negative impacts on other business areas when optimizing one part of the funnel.

## Lulu Cheng Meservey

- The concentric circles framework can be used for propagating product updates, starting with power users.

## Madhavan Ramanujam

- The winners in AI will need to master monetization from day one. If you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you start at training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, you're in trouble.
- Frame POCs as “business case creation” instead of technical demos.

## Madhavan Ramanujam

- Pricing is a cross-functional discipline, but ultimately a function of product.
- 'Willingness to pay' conversations should happen early and often, even before a blueprint is drawn.
- Willingness to pay is a proxy for 'do people actually want your product?'.
- Have the same sales and marketing conversation with the customer six months before launch that you would have at launch.
- Test for willingness to pay for every single feature that goes into the product.
- Use methods like Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter, Gabor-Granger, and conjoint analysis to learn about willingness to pay.
- Revisit pricing at least once a year, or when there are major market changes or product updates.
- Focus on benefits vs. features when communicating value.

## Maggie Crowley

- The three common traits among the best product managers are simplification, follow-up, and doing the hard, un-fun work.
- Strategy is an important but small part of the PM job.
- To get better at simplification, focus on the core problem and communicate it clearly.
- Simplify your writing by using shorter sentences and avoiding jargon.
- Ownership as a PM means taking responsibility for the outcome, not just the output.
- Improve on following up on your work by setting reminders and having a system to track progress.
- A realistic time horizon for PMs to see the impact of their work is often longer than they think, sometimes years.
- Maggie’s step-by-step process for writing your product strategy involves understanding the company mission, identifying a customer problem, defining a vision, and then outlining the steps to get there.
- Not every feature needs a deep, complex strategy document. Sometimes a simple one-pager is enough.
- The value of working through the strategy process is not just the final document, but the alignment and clarity it creates for the team.
- Maggie’s one-pager doc is a concise way to communicate the most important aspects of a product strategy.
- Being too “data-driven” can be a red flag if it leads to a lack of vision and an over-reliance on incremental improvements. Data should inform, not dictate, decisions.

## Manik Gupta

- To build a successful consumer product, you need a 'consumer stack' which includes a deep understanding of the customer, a clear product vision, a strong team, and a culture of experimentation.
- Promotions in a PM career come from taking on more responsibility, delivering results, understanding the business and market, and building strong relationships.
- Career inflections for PMs are created by moving to a new company or industry, taking on new roles or challenges, and developing new skills.
- PMs can fail by being too focused on details, lacking influence, and being unable to adapt to change.
- A desired feature for Google Maps was a more personalized experience for discovering new places.

## Marc Benioff

- Experiment relentlessly, then scale what works. Don’t assume you know what will work. Try a ton of different ideas, campaigns, and strategies, and double down on what actually moves the needle. When you find something that resonates, turn it into your strategy.

## Marily Nika

- Every PM will be an AI PM in the future.
- PMs should learn to code to better communicate with engineers and understand technical constraints.
- AutoML can be used to improve processes, like turbine maintenance.
- When building AI products, it's important to understand the data requirements and the limitations of the models.
- PMs need to be able to explain to leadership why investing in AI is important.

## Marty Cagan

- Good product teams are not just 'feature factories' serving the business; they are empowered to serve customers in ways that are viable for the business.
- The best product teams possess a deep, holistic understanding of their users, data, business stakeholders, and industry landscape.
- Truly empowered product teams are given problems to solve, not a list of features to build.
- The emphasis should be on 'solution discovery'—finding the best way to solve a problem—rather than just 'problem discovery'.
- A product manager's core responsibility is to synthesize information from various sources to make informed decisions about the product's value and viability.

## Matt Abrahams

- No specific points on product management frameworks, processes, etc. The content is focused on communication skills.

## Matt Dixon

- The best salespeople are challengers. They don’t think about what’s keeping a customer up at night; they think about what should be keeping a customer up at night. They teach the customer their insights from working with many similar customers, problems, and solutions.
- Most deals are lost to “no decision” rather than to competition, i.e. it’s not that the customer didn’t buy your software because they wanted to go with someone else’s; it’s that they didn’t buy any at all, despite genuinely exploring the opportunity.
- Shift from asking the customer what they want to confidently recommending what they should do. Options are great early on but eventually become overwhelming. Just like a waiter in a fancy restaurant, it’s no help to ask vague questions like “What are you in the mood for?” Instead, take a stance, justify your recommendation, and guide the customer to a decision. They will appreciate your sharing the burden of a potentially bad decision.

## Matt LeMay

- A critical question for any product team to consider is: 'If you were the CEO, would you fully fund your own team?' An inability to answer this question with a confident 'yes' is a red flag.
- The 'low-impact PM death spiral' describes a situation where teams focus on minor features and cosmetic improvements, which ultimately leads to a lack of demonstrable impact and potential layoffs.
- To be an 'impact-first' product team, ensure that your team's goals are directly aligned with and no more than one step removed from the company's primary objectives.
- The core responsibility of a product manager is to identify and prioritize work that is defensible, evidence-based, and customer-centric.
- It is imperative to align all product development efforts with business-critical outcomes, as this is the ultimate measure of a product team's success.
- A product team is a good investment for the business when its contributions are clearly understood and valued by leadership, including the CEO.

## Matt MacInnis

- The product is the highest order bit to execute on. If the product is the best it can be, everything else in the business is easier: sales, operations, marketing, everything.
- To change what you build, change how teams are structured and communicate first. Work backward from your desired product architecture to design the organizational structure that will naturally produce it (Conway's Law).
- The Product Quality List (PQL) framework helps see if someone has really thought through their idea. If someone comes to you with an idea, have them describe it to you without using the buzzwords from the initial pitch.

## Matt Mochary

- To foster innovation within a larger organization, establish a separate 'lab' with its own cap table, brand, and board. The parent company should be treated as a customer and service provider. This autonomy allows the new venture to maintain focus and protects it from the parent company's established processes and culture that might otherwise hinder its progress.

## Matthew Dicks

- Storytelling can be used to make product presentations more engaging and memorable.
- Use personal stories to connect with the audience and make data more relatable.

## Megan Cook

- Getting buy-in is a journey, not a one-time event. Meet with stakeholders early, explain your proposal, listen to their feedback, and iterate. When stakeholders co-create an idea, they are more likely to support it.
- Use the "10 dollar game" for prioritization. Team members allocate a hypothetical $10 among various priorities to reveal what they truly value.
- Atlassian uses a gated process for new product ideas, allowing for controlled investment and validation at each stage.
- To stay ahead of competition, Jira focuses on its core strengths and addresses customer pain points directly.

## Melanie Perkins

- Find a problem and understand that problem really, really well before building a solution.
- Spend a lot of time on the onboarding process to make users feel confident quickly.
- Refining the user experience is a continuous and crucial process.
- A strong initial product vision can remain consistent for years, with new features and content added over time.
- Iterate on proven concepts from previous products or versions.
- Directly engage with customers through methods like phone tutorials to gather feedback and refine the interface.

## Melissa Perri and Denise Tilles

- Product operations is a role that helps to streamline the product development process and make it more efficient.
- The three pillars of product ops are: business and data insights, customer and market insights, and process and governance.
- Product ops can help to offload tasks from product managers, such as data analysis, user research, and project management.
- Product managers should own the vision, strategy, and roadmap for their products.
- Product ops can help to ensure that the product development process is aligned with the company's overall business goals.

## Melissa Perri

- The most common problem in product teams is the lack of a clear, prioritized strategy that is effectively communicated and deployed across the organization.
- A CPO is needed when a company transitions from a single product to a multi-product portfolio, requiring a comprehensive product strategy and better communication with the executive team and board.
- Signs a CPO is needed: executives and board don't know what's happening in product/tech, product managers are frustrated by lack of direction, trouble hiring PMs, and many junior PMs with no training path.
- A CPO is typically hired when a company is above $10 million in ARR, moving towards $20-30 million, has a multi-product portfolio, is expanding geographically, or undergoing a major transformation like a merger.
- A Head of Product or VP of Product is a functional leader, good at implementing processes and managing one or two products. A CPO is an executive who deeply understands financials, can create revenue projections from the roadmap, and can oversee multiple functions beyond just product.
- A key sign of a lack of strategy is when teams are working hard but business metrics are not moving.
- Product strategy is not just a plan, but a framework that helps make decisions and trade-offs.

## Mike Maples, Jr.

- Structure your pitch deck with three slides: 1. What you do, 2. Your unique insight, 3. Proof points.
- 80% of biggest returning investments came from a pivot.
- If you have the right insight, you can navigate the implementation to get product-market fit.

## Molly Graham

- OKRs are often hated because they are implemented poorly, not because the concept is flawed. They should be a tool for focus and alignment, not a performance management system.
- When setting goals, focus on the 'why' before the 'what'. Ensure everyone understands the purpose behind the goals to foster alignment and motivation.
- Don't let goal-setting become a bureaucratic exercise. Keep the process lightweight and focused on driving impact.

## Nancy Duarte

- PMs telling great stories: Airbnb's Snow White storyboards as an example of using storytelling to communicate the customer journey.
- The Minto Pyramid Principle: A framework for structuring communication and presentations.
- The Duarte process for crafting presentations: A systematic approach to developing presentations.
- Annotation system for slide decks to manage edit cycles and version control, especially in large enterprise projects with many contributors.

## Naomi Gleit

- The role of a product manager is like a conductor, bringing together a team of talented individuals to create something that no one person could create on their own.
- Don’t outsource your critical thinking. Prioritize time to think about your strategies and decisions.
- Create a central, canonical document for each project that outlines key information: work streams, owners, processes, and meeting norms.
- When running meetings, send an agenda with pre-read materials 24 hours in advance, use visuals to anchor discussions, present three options with a recommendation, edit decisions and next steps in real-time, and send follow-up notes within 24 hours.

## Naomi Ionita

- Don't set pricing and forget it. Revisit your monetization strategy every 6-12 months, in line with your product roadmap.
- The true signal of product-market fit is when people open their wallets and pay you.
- When deciding what to include in a freemium product, the core functionality that gets users to the 'aha' moment and habit formation must be free.
- A simple framework for what to put in a freemium plan vs. paid: 'Day one' premium features (value from the first use) vs. 'Day one-hundred' premium features (value after extended use). Don't waste users' cognitive load on day one-hundred features initially.
- Match price to value. The price should be based on the unit of value the customer derives from the product. This creates a natural escalator.
- A single premium tier is often a mistake and leaves money on the table. Use multiple tiers to segment customers.
- Have a cross-functional pricing team.

## Nickey Skarstad

- To maintain product quality, define what quality means for your product, establish principles, and create a quality score based on metrics like customer satisfaction, app crash rates, and contact rates.
- The structure of a product organization should be based on the customer problem you're trying to solve. A GM model works well for distinct customer segments, while a functional model is better for horizontal products.
- A clear vision is essential for building a successful product. This vision must be articulated to the team and translated into measurable and achievable goals.
- OKRs are a useful tool for setting goals, but they should be used to empower teams, not to micromanage them.
- Influence is a critical skill for product managers. It's about building relationships, communicating effectively, and being able to tell a compelling story.
- Understanding the difference between one-way and two-way door decisions is crucial for making good decisions. One-way door decisions are irreversible and require more careful consideration, while two-way door decisions can be easily reversed.

## Nikita Miller

- Outcomes are important, but output is a key indicator. Shipping to market quickly is crucial.
- Trello is a task management tool for anyone, focused on simplicity and ease of use, good for single-player or multi-player mode. It's not just for software teams.
- The Roles and Responsibilities framework helps align teams by clarifying who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (RACI).
- Every team should have an embedded data scientist to help with data-informed decision-making.
- The product manager's role is becoming more about influence and less about direct authority.

## Noam Lovinsky

- Knowing when to kill a project is just as valuable as knowing when to start one. Reallocating resources away from a draining project, even if it risks your own position, can lead to team success and open new impactful opportunities.
- The best product managers keep an eye out for potentially successful situations and snap them up. Find projects that are high-impact and career-additive.
- Prioritizing what’s best for the business is the most important job of a product leader. This is more important than what is best for the user or your career.
- At Thumbtack, they established principles about which side of the marketplace to serve in which order. They decided to focus on the pros (supply) first, to create a great customer experience, which in turn would attract more customers (demand).
- When building a new product, it's important to start small and build community density.

## Oji Udezue and Ezinne Udezue

- The core value of a PM is to de-risk the business by finding the intersection of desirability, viability, and feasibility.
- PMs can now invest more in developing true insights about their customers because AI is automating many of the mundane tasks.
- The "shipyard team" model is a new way to structure product orgs that embraces chaos and crushes the old EPD handoff model. It's a six-capability team: PM, engineering, design, user research, data/ML/AI, and product marketing.
- Roles will become blurrier, and PMs will need to do more design, engineering, and data work.
- "Sharp problems" are the key to building successful products. These are problems that are so painful that if you improve them 3-5x, customers will flock to you.
- To find sharp problems, talk to customers and understand their pain points. Look for high-frequency problems.
- The cycle time for learning about customer needs has to be faster.

## Paige Costello

- Asana's product development process has evolved from being project-based to pillar-based, with more precise and opinionated inputs to create more agency and accountability.
- Asana uses a rolling 12-month plan that is revisited every six months, with higher confidence in the immediate half.
- The Double Diamond process is used at Asana to first go broad on customer problems, then narrow to a specific problem, then go broad on solutions, and finally narrow to a specific solution.
- The 3Es framework for product sense consists of Empathy, Expertise, and Evidence.
- To garner trust and win over skeptics, it is important to bring insights and have a deep understanding of the customer, market, and competitors.

## Patrick Campbell

- Your tempo and shipping frequency are more important than your product management framework.
- A common mistake is for teams to be smart but always be planning and not shipping.
- Mission metrics are crucial for shipping. They are the north star that guides the team's work.

## Paul Adams

- The ideal product team ratio is 1:1:5 (1 PM, 1 Product Designer, 4-5 Engineers).
- Use a strict one-page rule for product requirement docs (PRDs) to force focus and clarity.
- Employ a 6-year, 6-month, 6-week roadmap for product planning.
- The 6-year plan should be a vision for how the world will change because of your product, not a prediction of technology.
- The 6-month plan is a pragmatic timeline to build towards the vision.
- The 6-week plan outlines the immediate, concrete work to be done.
- Aim for 10x improvements, not 10% incremental changes, to redefine the problem you are solving.

## Paul Millerd

- The 'default path' in a career is a pre-defined script of success, often involving a traditional job, continuous work, and societal expectations. It's important to consciously choose this path rather than blindly following it.
- The 'pathless path' is an embrace of uncertainty and a shift away from the traditional career ladder. It involves designing your work around your interests and values, rather than conforming to a predefined role.
- The 'ship, quit, and learn' framework is a way to experiment with new career directions. It involves shipping a project, quitting your job to focus on it, and learning from the experience.

## Pete Kazanjy

- Founders should do sales to figure out what to build.
- The minimum viable version of a product will likely suck, and sales helps iterate.
- Founder-led sales is the sequel to The Lean Startup.

## Peter Deng

- The five PM archetypes: Consumer (design-obsessed), Growth (data-driven skeptic), Business/GM (margin-focused), Platform (builds tools for others), or Research/AI (technical depth).
- Know your PM archetype and hire for complementary strengths.
- Team composition is more important than individual talent. Design your team like a role-playing-game party where everyone has different stats and abilities that complement each other perfectly.
- Create healthy tension: Deliberately hire people with opposing strengths (growth vs. craft, data vs. intuition). The debates between them produce better products than consensus would.
- Balancing craft and practicality in product management is crucial.
- You don’t need a tech breakthrough to build a huge business. Facebook, Instagram, and Uber built billion-dollar businesses on existing technology. The breakthrough was understanding human needs and applying relentless craft.

## Phyl Terry

- Create your own “job mission” using OKRs to counter the fact that many job descriptions don’t clearly define what the company or role is trying to achieve. This helps develop insightful interview questions and shows initiative.

## Rahul Vohra

- A methodical system inspired by Sean Ellis can be used to find product-market fit and algorithmically determine a roadmap.
- Ignore feedback from users who don’t love your product’s core value—focus on the “somewhat disappointed” users for whom your main benefit resonates.
- Most B2B software slows down because companies shift from “solution deepening” (improving product) to “market widening” (expanding platform support).
- When selling to enterprise, understand that user needs and institutional requirements create a multi-threaded sale with different stakeholders.

## Ray Cao

- TikTok's product organization operates on the principle of 'context, not control,' fostering decentralized decision-making.
- The company culture embraces an 'always day one' mentality, prioritizing speed and continuous innovation.
- OKRs are used for planning and goal setting, a practice influenced by Google.

## Robby Stein

- When introducing transformative technology, start from the first principles of the user’s problem. However, lean on “well-worn paths” and existing user mental models. A new design pattern is only justified if it provides a massive leap in value that overcomes the cost of changing user habits.
- Focus on solving a valuable problem with clear metrics for success (like “helpfulness”).
- Use specific fine-tuning and prompting to align AI models with your product goals to ensure a consistent user experience.
- Defining success is critical because AI experience models have many degrees of freedom and can go in multiple directions.

## Roger Martin

- Strategy is an integrated set of choices that compels a desired customer action.
- The Strategy Choice Cascade is a framework for defining and implementing effective business strategies. It consists of five questions:
    1. What is our winning aspiration?
    2. Where will we play?
    3. How will we win?
    4. What capabilities must be in place to win?
    5. What management systems are required to ensure the capabilities are in place?

## Ryan Hoover

- The best ideas are simple, elegant, useful, and delightful.
- The story behind an idea is just as important as the idea itself.

## Sam Lessin

- Product management is not just about the product, but also about building trust with your team and stakeholders.
- Etiquette and social skills are crucial for product managers to effectively communicate and collaborate.

## Sam Schillace

- The journey of building Google Docs highlights the power of starting with a small, hacked-together experiment to solve a real problem.
- When evaluating a new, potentially disruptive idea, look for a strong, bifurcated reaction from users. A mix of passionate love and hate is a better indicator of impact than lukewarm acceptance.
- If people dismiss your idea as a 'toy,' it might be a strong signal that you're onto something truly innovative and disruptive.
- The future of documents is moving towards more dynamic, collaborative, and AI-powered canvases that can incorporate various forms of media and data.

## Scott Belsky

- The biggest mistake product teams make is becoming passionate about a solution devised in a conference room and losing empathy for the customer and the problem.
- Empathy for the customer provides the solution, while passion for a pre-conceived solution can be a distraction.
- Crafting product experiences is fundamentally about understanding user psychology.
- In the first 30 seconds of using a new product (the 'first mile'), users are lazy, vain, and selfish; they want to accomplish their goal quickly, look good doing it, and avoid any learning curve.
- Most teams disproportionately focus on power-user features (90% of energy) versus the first-mile experience for new users (10%).
- The 'first mile' encompasses the onboarding flow, the initial user experience, the default settings, and the overall orientation.
- The onboarding process must be continuously reimagined because each new cohort of customers has different expectations and tolerance levels.
- Products should adapt to the user, for example, by using AI to tailor the experience, rather than offering a single, generic onboarding flow.
- To build true empathy, observe customers using your product in their native environment, not a controlled lab setting, to understand the real-world context and distractions.
- The 'golden gut' is the intuition a product leader develops from experience, allowing them to make the right call even without complete data.
- To build better products, 'only do half the things you want to do.' Focus on a very small set of features and make them exceptional, rather than building a mediocre product with too many features.
- The craft and attention to detail are what separate great products from good ones, and this is only possible with a focused scope.

## Scott Wu

- Devin is a fully autonomous AI engineer that integrates into your team’s tools (Slack, Linear, GitHub) and autonomously handles writing code and making making pull requests.
- Engineers are moving from bricklayers to architects—being able to focus on high-level design while AI handles implementation.

## Sean Ellis

- The Sean Ellis Test is a leading indicator of product-market fit. Ask users, ‘How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?’ with options: ‘Very disappointed,’ ‘Somewhat disappointed,’ ‘Not disappointed,’ or ‘Not applicable.’
- If 40% or more of users respond with ‘Very disappointed,’ it’s a strong indication of product-market fit.
- Analyze the ‘very disappointed’ user group to understand their needs and values, then use these insights to refine the product, messaging, and feature set.
- The primary goal is to expand the ‘very disappointed’ user base to at least 40% of all users.
- The ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) framework is a prioritization method that streamlines decision-making by evaluating ideas on a 1-10 scale across these three criteria.
- A North Star metric should represent the core value delivered to users, be actionable, scalable, and correlate with revenue without being revenue itself.

## Shaun Clowes

- Many product managers are ineffective because they focus too much on internal processes rather than external factors.
- A 10x product manager spends about 80% of their time focused on the customer, the market, and the competition.
- The primary role of a product manager is to find and articulate a vision for differentiated value that the team can uniquely deliver.
- Product managers should not just gather customer feedback, but synthesize it, look for counter-arguments, and compare it with actual product usage data.
- Data should be used as a compass to disprove hypotheses, not as a GPS to provide all the answers.
- Over-reliance on data can lead to analysis paralysis; decisions should be made with sufficient, but not necessarily complete, information (Colin Powell's 40-70 rule).

## Shishir Mehrotra

- Eigenquestions: This is a concept Mehrotra uses to identify the most fundamental question that, if answered, would make all other questions irrelevant. It's a way to focus on the core of a problem.

## Shreyas Doshi

- Annual planning cycles are often inefficient, taking 4-6 weeks with little to show for it. A strong product strategy can reduce this to a few days.
- A well-defined and communicated product strategy is essential for effective prioritization and decision-making, and for avoiding unnecessary work.
- Don't blindly follow planning templates or processes that don't make sense for your product or team.
- The LNO (Leverage, Neutral, Overhead) framework is a useful tool for time and energy management.
- Be cautious when applying mental models like the 'two-way door' decision framework; always consider the specific context and potential customer impact.
- Many execution problems are, at their core, strategy problems.

## Shreyas Doshi

- Pre-mortems are a useful tool for de-risking projects by imagining failure scenarios and working backward to identify potential causes.
- The LNO framework helps prioritize tasks by categorizing them as Leverage, Neutral, or Overhead.
- Many execution problems are actually strategy problems in disguise.
- Opportunity cost thinking is more effective for product planning than ROI-based thinking.
- The three levels of product work are Product-Market Fit, Product-Business Fit, and Product-Ecosystem Fit.

## Shweta Shrivastava

- At Waymo, the product team is responsible for the end-to-end customer experience, from the app to the in-car experience.
- Product managers at Waymo need to have a deep understanding of both hardware and software.
- The company uses a simulation-first approach to test new features and scenarios before deploying them in the real world.
- Waymo's product development process is highly iterative, with a focus on learning and adapting quickly.
- The company uses a variety of metrics to track its progress, including commercial, operational, and system behavior metrics.

## Sri Batchu

- Start with founder-led sales to ensure the early team knows how to sell.
- The effectiveness of marketing channels increases as you gain a deeper understanding of your customers.
- Use data and technology to make every channel more efficient.
- Align the goals of the growth engineering team with the sales team, having them own the same output metrics.
- A growth engineering team can help with finding the right prospects, crafting the right messaging, and prioritizing leads.
- Structure the growth team with specialized sub-teams for paid growth, field marketing, product engineering for growth and sales, and a 'skunk works' team for experimentation.
- Maintain a razor-sharp focus on reducing cycle time and a bias to action.
- Constantly remind the team of the company's age in days, not years, to instill a sense of urgency.
- Foster a strong culture of experimentation and be open to failure.

## Stewart Butterfield

- Utility Curves: A mental model for understanding the value of a feature versus the effort invested. It's an S-curve that helps in deciding where to invest resources. You need to determine if a feature is on the low-value part of the curve, the steep part where investment yields high returns, or the flat top where further investment has diminishing returns.
- Don’t make me think: The primary goal should be to reduce the cognitive load on the user, not just the number of clicks. If a user has to stop and think to understand your software, it creates a feeling of stupidity and frustration.
- The Owner’s Delusion: Founders and product builders are often too close to their product to see it from a fresh perspective. They have a level of understanding that a new user doesn't. It's crucial to get feedback from people who are not involved in the development process.
- Friction can be beneficial: While the common wisdom is to always reduce friction, sometimes it's necessary for comprehension. Forcing a user to make a decision can be a good thing if it helps them understand the product and its value.
- Taste in Product Design: Taste is a real and learnable skill that can be a significant competitive advantage. It's about having a high degree of consideration for the user's experience and paying attention to the details that create delight.

## Tamar Yehoshua

- Prototyping is key: Before full-scale development, invest time in creating prototypes to validate concepts and gather feedback.
- Streamlining OKR reviews with async methods.

## Tanguy Crusson

- Atlassian uses a four-phase approach to launching new products: Wonder (proving the problem and market size), Explore (validating solutions cheaply), Make (building an alpha/beta), and Impact (showing business impact).
- It is crucial to articulate the 'why now' in any business case to create urgency and secure investment.
- The 'Lighthouse Users' program involves engaging with a small group of early adopters to gather feedback and iterate on the product.
- Existing playbooks may not work for new products, especially when targeting new customer segments. It's important to test and validate all assumptions.
- New products should be judged by whether the team is answering the right questions at the right pace, not by traditional metrics like MAUs or revenue.
- Avoid the temptation to prematurely scale or optimize for metrics before fully understanding the customer problem.
- 'Dogfooding,' or using your own product internally, is a powerful way to identify issues and improvements.
- Protect new, unproven ideas ('ugly babies') from premature criticism to allow them to develop.

## Greg Isenberg, Sahil Bloom

- N/A

## Timothy Davis

- Performance marketing is a key component of product-led growth (PLG), as it helps to acquire users that can then be activated and retained through the product.

## Tobi Lütke

- Great product leadership requires three key elements: the ability to see around corners and anticipate what’s coming, infectious enthusiasm and genuine care about the product, and getting the team to deeply care about what they’re building.
- Focus on unquantifiable qualities like joy and delight in product design.
- If you’re feeling scared to launch something, reframe it as an experiment. Take the pressure off yourself and simply focus on learning. By lowering the emotional stakes, you’ll be able to take risks and move faster without letting fear hold you back.

## Tom Conrad

- At Pandora, the focus was on a single metric: the percentage of users who said "I love this song" to a track. This North Star metric guided product development.
- The team at Pandora was relentless about not letting the product become cluttered with features that didn't serve the core user experience of music discovery.
- When Tom joined Snap, the product team was small and not deeply integrated into the engineering-driven culture. He had to build the product management function from the ground up.
- Zero, Tom's current company, uses a product development process that is heavily influenced by user feedback and data from the app.

## Tomer Cohen

- The 'full-stack builder' model empowers builders to take ideas to market, regardless of their role.
- The traditional product development process has become too complex and slow, with too many sub-steps and specialized roles.
- The core of a builder's role is simple: take an idea and bring it to life.
- Key traits for a builder: vision, empathy, creativity, and judgment.
- The full-stack builder model leads to smaller, more focused teams.
- The goal is to automate the 'how' (the process) and let builders focus on the 'what' and 'why' (the product and the user).
- At LinkedIn, they are building a platform with composable UI components and a developer platform to enable full-stack builders.

## Tomer Cohen

- Start product strategy by thinking backwards from the ultimate potential of the platform, not from its current state. For LinkedIn, this meant seeing it as a platform for all economic opportunity, not just a social network. (Tomer Cohen)
- Spend significant time defining the problem you are trying to solve with high precision. For example, don't just aim to 'launch video'; specify the exact type of video, the target audience, and the unique value proposition. (Tomer Cohen)
- Use the 'mountain' analogy for roadmapping: have a very clear picture of the ultimate vision (the peak) and the immediate next steps (the base camp), but it's okay for the path between them to be less defined. (Tomer Cohen)
- Set ambitious '10X' goals to push the team beyond incremental thinking and unlock transformative impact. (Tomer Cohen)

## Upasna Gautam

- OKRs at CNN are set quarterly, with a structured process. Company-wide OKRs are set by leadership, and then individual teams create their own that ladder up. There are mid-quarter check-ins and end-of-quarter reviews.
- Roadmaps are long-term visions, living documents that are constantly updated. They are a list of outcomes, not features, focusing on the "why".
- Involve the tech lead in all product discovery and product review meetings to get a technical perspective from the beginning.
- To balance maintenance and tech debt, dedicate a percentage of time each quarter (e.g., 20-30%) to it. Celebrate this work to keep morale high.
- When working with internal users (journalists), have weekly demo days, working sessions, breaking news dress rehearsals, and office hours to maintain open communication and gather feedback.
- Use working sessions for a combination of training, user testing, and feedback.
- Breaking news dress rehearsals are simulations to stress-test the platform.
- Be customer-centric and constantly talk to customers.
- Be data-informed and use data to make decisions.
- Be collaborative and work effectively with other teams.

## Uri Levine

- Product-market fit is the most important thing for a startup.
- The only metric for product-market fit is retention.
- If you lose product-market fit, you need to go back to square one and re-validate the problem and solution.
- A framework for evaluating a pivot:
    1. Validate that there’s a real problem worth solving.
    2. Assess if you have tech, team, or knowledge advantages.
    3. Check if you have the passion and energy for a new journey.
    4. Validate that your team wants to pursue this direction.
    5. Approach investors with the new vision.

## Varun Mohan

- The surprising UI discovery that tripled adoption rates overnight.
- When building AI products, invest as much in UI/UX design as model quality—Windsurf’s experience shows interface changes alone can triple adoption rates.
- Invest in understanding what truly differentiates your product—in AI, unique data (like Windsurf’s incomplete code states) can create moats that even companies with better base models can’t easily cross.
- Be willing to “bet the company” on pivots when your core assumptions change—Windsurf abandoned a profitable business when they realized generative AI would commoditize their infrastructure offering.
- For engineers and product managers: start using AI coding tools to modify existing codebases, not just for prototyping—this creates a competitive advantage while your colleagues are still figuring out the tools.
- Cannibalize your own product every 6-12 months to make it look 'silly' in comparison to the new version.

## Varun Parmar

- With every product release, you are either making a positive or negative move against your competitors. This framework helps to bring clarity to your actions and their impact.
- A multi-persona product that serves the entire team (designers, PMs, engineers, etc.) can be a strong competitive advantage.
- A hybrid organizational structure with streams aligned to specific charters (e.g., enterprise, platform, core product) and cross-functional AMPED teams within each stream can be effective.
- Having product marketing as part of the cross-functional team from the beginning helps with product adoption and go-to-market strategy.
- A continuous discovery and delivery process, informed by various inputs like company strategy, product vision, customer feedback, and market research, is essential for building successful products.
- OKRs should be outcome-oriented, ambitious, and aligned from the company level down to the team level.
- A portfolio approach to product development, balancing big bets, incremental improvements, and maintenance, is crucial. The Three Horizons framework can be used to manage this portfolio.

## Vijay Iyengar

- When a product is facing high churn due to missing features, a crisis-mode strategy is to list all churn reasons, group them by the required feature, sort the list by the associated ARR, and then make the top items the immediate roadmap.
- This churn-driven roadmap is a short-term solution to optimize for speed and stop the bleeding, but it can lead to a fragmented product and should be followed by a phase focused on holistic design.
- After an intense feature-shipping phase, it's crucial to focus on the product's system architecture to ensure consistency, discoverability, and high impact for future features. Great products often have a strong underlying architecture, like Notion's 'pages and blocks' model.
- To create space for strategic design work on system architecture, it may be necessary to temporarily decouple the design team from tactical, engineering-led feature projects.
- At Mixpanel, planning is done on a six-month cycle, with cross-functional teams organized around long-lived, often conflicting, problem pairs (e.g., power vs. simplicity) to force trade-off decisions within one team.
- The planning process involves leadership setting a strategic direction, teams ideating and developing 'bets' (problem, hypothesis, solution, and measurement), and leadership actively participating in the solutioning phase with the teams.

- The 'Five Whys' technique is a valuable method for root cause analysis.
- The branching and merging feature in Figma facilitates greater experimentation and iteration in the design process.
- It is beneficial for the entire company to use its own product to foster empathy and identify issues.

## Yuriy Timen

- The are three archetypes of subscription product growth: high LTV companies that can lean into paid acquisition, companies with network effects, and companies that can leverage programmatic SEO.
- It is very difficult to engineer network effects if they are not inherent to the product.
- Referral and viral loops can be effective even without inherent network effects if the product is highly beloved by its users.

## Zevi Arnovitz

- A non-technical PM can build sophisticated products using AI tools like Cursor.
- Use a structured workflow for building with AI: Create Issue -> Exploration -> Create Plan -> Execution -> Review -> Peer Review -> Ship.
- Use slash commands in Cursor to automate prompts and streamline your workflow.
- Create a "CTO" persona in your AI chat tool to get better technical advice and avoid people-pleasing responses.
- Start with simpler tools like Bolt or Lovable and "graduate" to more complex tools like Cursor as you outgrow them.
- Use a "peer review" technique where you have different AI models review each other's code to catch mistakes.
- Use AI to help with planning and creating a markdown plan before writing any code.

## Adam Fishman

- Your brand is the promise you make to the market, and your product experience is the delivery of that promise; these two must be in lockstep.
- A key responsibility for a growth-focused product manager is to generate hypotheses, learn from them through experimentation, and then productize those learnings.
- At Patreon, a personalized onboarding flow was created for creators, which was tailored to their specific needs based on their answers to a few questions.
- Patreon also used a checklist and a series of onboarding emails to guide creators through the process of getting started.

## Alexander Embiricos

- The product team at OpenAI constantly monitors user feedback on platforms like Reddit to understand both praise and complaints, which helps in shaping the product direction.
- The organizational structure at OpenAI is designed to be bottoms-up, empowering teams to innovate and make decisions.
- The vision for Codex is to evolve from a tool into a proactive teammate that assists throughout the entire development lifecycle.

## Anneka Gupta

- The PM skill of summarization: In meetings, practice summarizing discussions to ensure everyone is aligned. Try saying something like, “Let me pause and summarize what I’ve heard: Our customers are facing X challenges, and we believe Y is the solution. Is that an accurate reflection?” This approach fosters clarity, makes participants feel heard, and can break up circular conversations.
- When a founder is in founder mode, they are able to see around corners and anticipate the next big thing for the company. As a head of product, you can leverage this by making them an advocate for your initiatives.
- When a founder is pushing an idea, take a step back and objectively understand why they are pushing it. If you know the objective, you can have a conversation with the founder and propose alternative solutions.
- As a head of product, you have to decide whether to fight a founder's idea or let it go, making a judgment call on what will make or break the company.
- Understanding the details of the business and asking questions to the utmost extent is crucial for a product leader.
- A tactic for course correction is to ask the team to present their strategies for areas that might need it. This allows the leader to give feedback and guide the team without rewriting the entire strategy.

## Annie Pearl

- A non-traditional path to product management is viable; Annie Pearl transitioned from law school to a startup founder role and then into product management.
- The core of product management is deeply understanding user problems and building solutions, which is what drew her to the field.
- A CPO's primary responsibility shifts from execution to setting the product vision and strategy for the next 3-5 years.
- The role of a product manager evolves with the company's growth stage, from pure execution in pre-product-market fit startups to managing complexity in late-stage growth companies.
- Core product management skills that are transferable across industries include strategic thinking, product sense, leadership, and analytical thinking.
- A CPO's number one job is to create clarity around the product vision and strategy, which empowers the team and prevents siloed work.
- It's crucial for a CPO to understand the entire business, not just the product function, and to make decisions for the good of the company.
- New product bets take a long time to pay off, so it's important to start laying the foundational work early, even years in advance.
- Product development processes must be continuously monitored and adapted as the company scales and evolves.
- The relationship between the CPO and the founder/CEO is critical and requires a strong partnership.

## April Dunford

- Positioning defines how your product is the best in the world at something that a well-defined set of customers cares a lot about.
- Positioning encompasses: alternatives, differentiation, value, and target customers.
- Positioning is an internal alignment tool, messaging is the expression of that positioning, and branding is the look and feel.
- The five steps to figuring out your product’s positioning are:
    1. Competitive alternatives
    2. Unique capabilities
    3. Value derived from capabilities
    4. Customers that care about that value
    5. Market category
- You can't have good messaging or good branding without good positioning.
- Segmentation is dividing the market into groups of customers with similar needs. A persona is a representation of a specific type of customer within a segment.
- A common mistake in positioning is starting with differentiators instead of competitive alternatives.
- You know you have a positioning problem when customers don't understand your product, or they think it's like something else, or they don't understand the value.
- Positioning needs to be a group effort involving marketing, product, sales, customer success, and the executive team.
- Positioning needs to evolve as the product and market change.
- Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore is a recommended book for people in tech.

## Bob Moesta

- The Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework helps you understand the real competitors to your product from the customer's perspective.
- It's not just about identifying customer pain points and gains. The context in which the customer is making a decision is what gives a product its value.
- The customer's buying process can be broken down into six phases: first thought, passive looking, active looking, deciding, onboarding, and ongoing use.
- When conducting JTBD interviews, avoid using a discussion guide. The goal is to get the customer to tell you their story.
- A common mistake is to view the customer only through the lens of your product. You need to understand their world.
- To start applying JTBD, talk to recent customers and ask them to walk you through their buying journey.
- JTBD is not the right framework for every situation. It's not ideal for optimizing existing processes.

## Brian Chesky

- Airbnb has shifted its product management structure, with the CEO now acting as the chief product officer and product managers being rebranded as product marketers.
- The company has moved to a rolling two-year roadmap to provide a longer-term vision and direction.
- To foster a more integrated approach, Airbnb has eliminated separate guest and host teams, encouraging a holistic view of the platform.
- Engineers are now the primary drivers of the product roadmap, with a focus on technical innovation and feasibility.
- Product marketers are tasked with the successful launch and business outcomes of new features, bridging the gap between product development and market success.

## Brian Rothenberg

- Before focusing on growth, ensure you have achieved product-market fit and have a baseline level of retention. Don't pursue growth initiatives until these fundamentals are in place.
- When starting a growth effort, identify and lean into the 'light and heat'—the existing strengths and unique organic levers inherent to the product.
- If there are no obvious organic growth levers, focus on improving top-of-funnel conversion and activation, as a strong onboarding experience often correlates with better long-term retention.
- A successful growth strategy requires balancing the pursuit of quick wins to build momentum with making strategic, long-term investments in infrastructure and analytics.
- Horizontal platforms should 'verticalize' over time by creating tailored experiences for specific customer segments to combat the 'paradox of choice' and defend against niche competitors.

## Brie Wolfson

- To build great products, it's crucial to have a deep, intuitive understanding of the product, which Brie Wolfson refers to as "finger feel." This means being hands-on and staying close to the details.
- There's a constant tension between process and output, and between quality and speed. Great teams find a balance that works for their specific context.
- Great editing is not just about fixing typos; it's about ensuring the product is clear, concise, and delivers value to the user. It's about asking "Who is this for?" and "What will they get from this?"
- The planning function, as implemented at Stripe, is a way to bring more rigor and structure to the product development process.

## Camille Ricketts

- The way that you think about product market fit, you have to think about content market fit. So even though content feels like it's running adjacent to the actual product that you're putting out there, you still have to think about who is my audience? Who is the audience that I really want to have? Who is the audience that is going to be drawn to this most? Who are they? What is it that they really need in their lives? Even abstracting it from it at all. What is it that they need to get promoted? What is it that they need to avoid failure? What is it that causes them a great deal of anxiety in the day-to-day of their lives or their work? And can you create some type of content product that is going to address this for them?

## Casey Winters

- Avoid the 'zero interest rate phenomenon' where product managers become overly cautious and avoid taking risks, leading to a lack of innovation.
- Frameworks should be used as tools in a toolkit, not as a rigid set of rules to follow.
- Maintaining product-market fit is an ongoing challenge, as the needs of the business and the market are constantly evolving.
- OKRs should be quantitative, but it may take time to get a team to that level of maturity.

## Shreyas Doshi

- Pre-mortems are a proactive method to identify and mitigate risks early in a project's lifecycle by imagining its failure and working backward to uncover potential causes.
- The LNO (Leverage, Neutral, Overhead) framework is a system for prioritizing tasks to enhance effectiveness and reduce stress.
- Product work can be categorized into three levels, and understanding these levels can help in optimizing team efforts and avoiding conflict.
- Many issues that appear to be execution problems are, in fact, rooted in flawed strategy.
- Prioritization should be based on opportunity-cost thinking rather than being solely driven by ROI calculations, which can be detrimental to long-term product planning.

## Chetan Puttagunta

- The model layer stabilizing serves as a huge boon for investing in the application layer.
- The industry’s shift to reasoning enables application developers to move faster because they no longer have to wait around for step-function advancements made by the model layer.

## Dan Shipper

- AI can be used to analyze customer feedback at scale, by processing large volumes of text from sources like support tickets, social media, and forums. This helps product managers identify common pain points and feature requests more efficiently.
- AI-powered tools can assist in creating and maintaining product roadmaps by predicting the potential impact of features and suggesting prioritization based on business goals and customer value.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to summarize user research interviews, saving product managers significant time and helping them quickly identify key themes and insights.

- The Double Diamond framework, typically used in design and product, can be applied to personal growth and goal-setting.
- To be a great product leader, one must be a great storyteller.
- While user-centeredness is key in product development, effective leadership starts with the leader themselves, not just the team or customers.
- Empower senior team members by giving them problems to solve and a clear vision, rather than micromanaging their work.

## Dylan Field

- Intuition is a hypothesis generator. You generate many hypotheses and then winnow them down to a working hypothesis.
- The best product managers deliver outcomes and bring everyone along with them. They create a shared headspace and a happy team.
- Product management fails when it's too focused on process instead of the problems the team is solving.
- The future of product management is that it will become more and more important as products become more complex, and PMs will be the 'glue' that connects different teams and functions.
- When launching, aim for a 'minimally awesome product' - high quality, but not all the features.
- When starting a project, you can pick two of three: quality, features, and deadline. Figma chose quality and features, but Dylan Field thinks they should have picked a deadline and shipped with fewer features.
- It's important to talk to users and understand their needs, even if it contradicts your own intuition. For example, Dylan Field didn't want to ship 'pages' in Figma, but users were asking for it and it was a huge success.

## Elena Verna

- "Minimum lovable product" (MLP) is the new standard, not minimum viable product (MVP).
- Activation now belongs to product teams, not growth teams.
- In AI, you have to re-find product-market fit every 3 months.
- Software evolves from capability to value to workflow. AI is currently in the capability stage.

## Eliot Horowitz

- The document model is a more intuitive data model for most data because it aligns with how developers think about business objects in their code and in the real world.
- A query language that can index and query JSON documents is compelling for developers.
- Combining a document model with distributed systems solves problems around high availability and scalability.

## Emily Kramer

- Product marketing is the glue between product, marketing, and sales, responsible for positioning, messaging, go-to-market strategy, sales enablement, and competitive intelligence.
- A product person focuses on the 'fuel': the story, positioning, messaging, and user experience; they are creative and strategic.
- For a startup's first marketing hire, a generalist product marketer who has experience in both 'fuel' and 'engine' tasks is ideal.
- To assess a product marketer's skills, give them a project to position, message, and launch a product.
- Effective collaboration between product and marketing teams requires shared goals (revenue), a shared understanding of the user, a shared process, and a shared language.

## Erica Feidner

- Develop a deep and comprehensive understanding of your product inventory.
- Regularly review and familiarize yourself with the entire product line to become a true expert.
- Create a system for categorizing and rating products based on their unique characteristics and features to facilitate better recommendations.

- The post-acquisition experience is often an afterthought, but it is critical for recurring revenue businesses.
- Freemium products should be considered a marketing tool and owned by the marketing team.
- Customer journey mapping is essential for understanding the complete customer experience, including their life before and after using the product.
- The Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework is a powerful tool for understanding the underlying motivations and needs of customers.

## Grace Isford

- Ultimately, I learned how to build a great product, ask the why questions, architect each product sprint, and align these products to a north-star goal for the company's growth and development. - Grace Isford
- On Growth: Think about how you will grow your wedge over time. I encourage all companies I work with to think about how to become a true platform company and grow not just the ACV (average contract size) but also the product suite. That means thinking strategically about how each new product launch can build towards the north star goal. - Grace Isford
- Focus on creating a product that's actually solving a problem: You would be surprised how often I saw companies that had developed products without addressing the pain point. Customers are way more willing to adopt the product and pay for it if you solve a problem for them. So always go where there is the greatest pain for your end user and where you can truly provide value. - Grace Isford

## Hubert Palan

- Product management is a multidimensional problem.
- When deciding what to build, consider the size of the segment, how many similar companies exist, willingness to pay, and additional requirements.
- Traditional project management tools like Jira and Asana lack the concept of a customer and their pain points.
- Product management is about understanding customer needs and deciding what to do about them.
- Roadmaps are a conversation, not a one-way document. They should facilitate a bidirectional flow of information.
- Tools like roadmaps, customer interview snapshots, ideal customer profiles, competitive landscapes, and journey maps help leaders share context and set direction.

## Jackie Bavaro

- A strategy has three components: vision, strategic framework, and roadmap.
- A good strategy connects the dots from a high-level business goal to the features you're going to build.
- A roadmap in strategy is not a commitment, but a way to check if the plan is feasible.
- To get better at strategy, collaborate with stakeholders, listen to their feedback, and see things through to see the results of your decisions.
- PMs should start thinking about strategy from day one, first by understanding it, and then by influencing it as they get more senior.
- Signs of a bad strategy: you're constantly explaining it, you're not making progress on your goals, or you're constantly changing it.
- Every PM should talk to customers.
- The PM's role is not to say no to everything, but to find a way to say yes and still do their job. This can be done by interpreting ideas as problems to be solved and brainstorming solutions.

## James Currier

- The best product builders are both filled with positive faith in the product AND are ruthlessly self-critical.

## James Mayes

- Mind the Product's mission is to bring product people together, share great stories, and further the craft of product management.
- User events like Pendo's Pendomonium are focused on customers, providing them with information about the product and company roadmap.
- Industry-wide communities like Mind the Product serve as an open house for the entire industry to connect and have conversations.
- Maintaining editorial independence is crucial for a product community, even after an acquisition, to ensure unbiased content and curation.
- Customer feedback and market demand (e.g., for content on product ops) can be valuable input for content strategy.

## Jason Fried

- The “Shape Up” framework is used for building products, which involves working in six-week cycles.
- Features are developed by small teams of two: one programmer and one designer.
- Hill charts are used to track the progress of projects.
- Long-term business planning is a fantasy; instead, plan in 6-week stretches and figure things out as you go.
- Less is more: you might be better off with less planning, people, and product features.

## Jen Abel

- The transcript does not contain much information about product management.

## Jules Walter

- There are two main paths to becoming a product manager: joining a startup and doing product work, or switching to a PM role within a company where you have domain expertise.
- When starting as a PM, focus on developing your 'IQ skills'—product sense, execution, and strategy—to build credibility.
- As you advance in your career, 'EQ skills' like self-awareness, communication, and relationship building become increasingly important.
- To improve your product sense, execution, and strategy, it's helpful to identify and learn from best practices in the field.

## Julie Zhuo

- The 'diagnose with data, treat with design' framework is crucial for balancing intuition and experimentation in product development.
- Data is a tool for diagnosing problems, not for dictating solutions. It helps in understanding what is happening, but the 'why' and 'how to improve' often come from design and user research.
- While hyper-growth AI companies might initially succeed on 'good instincts and good vibes,' they eventually need to build a solid data infrastructure to make informed decisions.
- Defining a clear goal and outcome is the most critical step in any project, whether managing a team of people or a suite of AI agents. Ambiguity in goals leads to misalignment and poor outcomes.
- Metrics and KPIs are essential for creating an objective measure of success and ensuring everyone is aligned on what 'good' looks like.

## Karina Nguyen

- Going from a chatbot to a collaborative agent is a step towards more general systems.
- Rapid model iteration is key for product improvement, especially when deploying to users.
- For the Canvas feature, the team focused on three main behaviors: when to trigger it, how to update the document based on user requests, and how to get higher quality edits.
- User feedback is crucial for shifting and improving the product over time.

## Keith Yandell

- The WeDash program, where employees participate in deliveries, provides direct product feedback and helps in identifying and fixing bugs.
- When managing a new function without prior experience, the key is to hire top talent and provide them with the autonomy to succeed.
- A 'How to Work with Me' document is a useful tool for establishing clear communication and collaboration guidelines.
- The T3 B3 framework for one-on-ones helps in tracking progress and addressing challenges effectively.
- For efficient decision-making, it is crucial to have a single-threaded owner for each decision and a defined timeline.
- Building strong relationships with product and design counterparts requires empathy and active listening.
- When establishing a business development team within a product-focused company, it is important to have a clear charter and defined responsibilities.

## Ken Norton

- The 'art' of product management, which includes communication, collaboration, and people skills, is as important, if not more important, than the 'science' of product management, which includes technical skills and backlog management.
- Product managers are leaders from day one, even without formal authority, and should use this as an opportunity to develop their leadership skills.
- The most challenging aspect of leadership is leading without formal authority, which is the default situation for product managers.
- It is important to invest in 'soft skills' training, such as difficult conversations and storytelling, just as one would invest in technical skills.
- When a task seems difficult and ambiguous, it is often a sign that it is important and presents an opportunity for growth.
- Adopting a '10x vs 10%' mindset encourages focusing on transformational change rather than incremental improvements.

## Kristen Berman

- Budgeting features, even when highly requested, may not change user behavior. It's crucial to experiment and measure the actual impact of features.
- A/B testing is essential to validate hypotheses before investing heavily in feature development.
- Behavioral diagnosis: Map out every single step a user has to take to achieve a desired behavior to understand the friction and challenges involved.
- To change behavior, you have to do something different, not just have a goal. Redesign the environment to support the new behavior.
- Instead of just telling users the benefits of a product (e.g., through a carousel), actively engage them with questions about the benefits to increase their motivation.

## Krithika Shankarraman

- Product management and product marketing should work together as close partners from the very beginning of the product development process.
- A major reason for product failure is not doing the necessary work to deeply understand the customer and the market before building the product, as was the case with the initial launch of Stripe Atlas.

## Lauren Ipsen

- The three main types of PMs are platform product leaders, consumer-facing product leaders, and specialists (e.g., growth, monetization).
- When hiring a senior product leader, founders often make the mistake of hiring someone too senior who is too far from the work.
- Instead of hiring a big name, look for someone who is closer to the work and can step up into the role.
- Before hiring a head of product, founders should ask themselves what problem they are trying to solve with this hire.
- It's crucial to define what success looks like for the role in the first 90 days and beyond.
- A common mistake is to hire a head of product to do everything, when in reality, the roles of a platform PM, a consumer-facing PM, and a growth PM are very different.

## Logan Kilpatrick

- High-agency team members who proactively seek solutions to customer problems without waiting for extensive consensus are invaluable.
- A culture of transparency and openness, where problems and ongoing issues are communicated, is beneficial for product development.

## Luc Levesque

- Focus on impact, not just industriousness. The best companies are relentless about focusing on the impact of their work.
- Wait to focus on growth until you have product-market fit. Don't try to scale a leaky bucket.

## Marty Cagan

- Customers purchase solutions, not problems.
- It is more important to focus on developing a winning solution than to spend a lot of time defining the problem.
- The role of a product manager is not limited to writing requirement documents like PRDs and user stories.
- In effective product teams, developers and designers are considered equal partners, not just implementers of ideas.
- Feature teams are typically given a roadmap with a list of prioritized features to build.
- In contrast, real product teams are given problems to solve, focusing on outcomes rather than output.

## Maya Prohovnik

- Dogfooding is crucial for product managers to understand user pain points. Maya Prohovnik insists her PMs create their own podcasts.
- Balancing data and intuition is key. Data tells you *what* is happening, but not *why*. Qualitative feedback is needed for the 'why'.
- To balance data and intuition, have a clear hypothesis, a clear success metric, and a clear decision-making framework.
- Example of a mistake: Anchor 2.0 initially didn't have a feed because the team was too focused on their vision of short-form audio and ignored user feedback.
- The importance of reducing friction for users. Anchor's obsession with making podcast creation easy was a key to their growth.

## Meltem Kuran Berkowitz

- The 'traffic light system' is a framework for categorizing content into three types: red (bottom-of-funnel, product-specific), yellow (mid-funnel, product-related), and green (top-of-funnel, industry-related).

## Merci Grace

- Great CEOs and startup leaders are exceptional storytellers.
- Start pitches with the unique insight to capture attention immediately, rather than with market size or other boilerplate information.
- A clear product vision (e.g., Slack as a 'tool for work') simplifies decision-making and helps prioritize features.
- Avoid copying features from successful products without understanding their actual performance and the context behind them.
- Slack's activation metric was determined to be three real users sending a total of 50 real messages.
- Understanding the 'why' behind user behavior is more important than just observing the 'what'.

## Michael Truell

- Cursor pivoted from automating CAD to automating code after identifying a larger opportunity and aligning with the team's expertise.
- Intense internal use of the product (dogfooding) and iterative development were key to Cursor's rapid success.
- The future of programming is envisioned as a new medium that is a higher level of abstraction than code, more like natural language or pseudocode.

## Mihika Kapoor

- To set the vision for a new idea, ask: “If I and my team do our job correctly, what does the world look like?” Then convey the pain point, solution, and proof in a format that can “show, not tell” stakeholders what you’re doing. For example, use prototypes, Figma mock-ups, and customer testimonials.
- The role of a 0-to-1 team within a large company is to always keep the project alive and help it spread to others, mostly through setting vision and building hype.
- Putting ideas out there, even if they are wrong, can lead to better solutions and more productive discussions.
- Internal hackathons are a great way to encourage innovation. Figma has a Maker Week where the entire company—including technical and non-technical employees—goes on pause for a week to work on ambitious ideas.

## Mike Krieger

- Product teams working directly with AI researchers drive 10x more value than those just building UX on top of models. Mike has shifted almost all product resources to embed with research teams, working on post-training and fine-tuning rather than just using models off the shelf.
- The future of product metrics in AI isn’t engagement—it’s actual value delivered. When Claude helps Mike prototype something in 25 minutes that would have taken six hours, that’s the metric that matters. Traditional engagement metrics can be misleading, when one good conversation could be 2 messages or 200.

## Nabeel S. Qureshi

- Much of Palantir’s success came from embedding engineers at client locations 4-5 days per week, creating rapid feedback cycles and deep customer understanding that traditional approaches couldn’t match.
- Palantir's model involves solving one customer’s (very big and valuable) problem, then abstracting that solution into a product you can sell to everyone else.
- At Palantir, you could only become a PM after proving yourself as a forward-deployed engineer.
- 95% of enterprise data problems involve access, cleaning and joining data, not analysis; companies that solve this integration challenge create tremendous value.

## Nicole Forsgren

- The DORA framework measures software delivery performance using four key metrics: lead time for changes, deployment frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR), and change fail rate.
- The SPACE framework provides a holistic view of developer productivity, encompassing Satisfaction and Well-being, Performance, Activity, Communication and Collaboration, and Efficiency and Flow.
- Shipping more frequently with smaller changes leads to more stable systems, as it reduces the blast radius of any potential failures and makes them easier to fix.
- Benchmarks for success in developer productivity are relative to an organization's own starting point; the focus should be on continuous improvement rather than comparison to other companies.
- To improve DevOps capabilities, it's effective to work backward from the desired outcomes and identify the necessary technical and process changes.

## Nicole Forsgren

- Most productivity metrics are a lie. Lines of code is a bad metric because it can be easily gamed, especially with AI.
- DORA metrics (deployment frequency, lead time, change fail rate, time to restore service) are still useful for assessing the overall health of the development pipeline, but they are not a direct measure of individual developer productivity.
- The SPACE framework provides a more holistic view of developer productivity, considering Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Communication and collaboration, and Efficiency and flow.
- Instead of focusing on output metrics like lines of code, it's better to focus on outcomes and the overall developer experience.

## Nikhyl Singhal

- Product managers should focus on their long-term career arc, not just the next promotion. Think about the job after the next, and what skills are needed to get there.
- Don't conflate career and promotion. A promotion is a short-term goal, while a career is a long-term journey.
- A diverse set of experiences is more valuable than collecting logos on a resume. Seek out experiences in different company stages (pre-product-market fit, scaling, large company) and domains (consumer vs. enterprise).
- Experience at a large tech company (MAGMA: Meta, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon) is valuable for learning how to operate at scale, especially for executives.
- Be wary of "ex-growth" companies, which are companies that have stopped growing but haven't failed. A sign of an ex-growth company is when hundreds of employees are still trying to find product-market fit.

## Nilan Peiris

- Used NPS to measure customer satisfaction and predict word-of-mouth growth.
- The best proxy for word of mouth was NPS.
- Overlaid NPS with word of mouth data and found a strong correlation.
- High NPS scores (9-10) correlated with high referral and conversion rates.
- Used NPS comments to identify product pillars: price, speed, and ease of use.
- To get to a 9 or 10 on the NPS scale, you need to be 8-10 times cheaper than the competition.
- The "working backward" method from Amazon was mentioned in the context of product development.

## Richard Rumelt

- A strategy is a design for overcoming a high-stakes challenge, a mix of policy and action, and should be called an 'action agenda'.
- A good strategy has a 'kernel' consisting of a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent actions.
- The most common form of bad strategy is mistaking goals for strategy; a list of wishes is not a strategy.
- To create a strategy, you must first identify the 'crux'—the hardest part of the problem.
- The actions in a strategy must be connected and there should be very few of them.

## Ronny Kohavi

- A/B testing is a key tool for product management to make data-informed decisions.
- The Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC) is a quantitative measure of the experiment's objective. It's crucial for measuring success and should be agreed upon before the experiment starts.
- Radical redesigns are very risky and most of them fail. It is much better to test incrementally and evolve a design.
- Institutional learning is critical. Documenting and sharing the results of experiments, both successes and failures, helps the organization to learn and avoid repeating mistakes.
- When you can't run a long-term experiment, you can use models to predict the long-term effects of a change.

## Ryan Singer

- The Shape Up method flips traditional product development by starting with a fixed time budget (“appetite”) and then shaping the scope to fit that budget, rather than estimating a timeline for a fixed scope.
- Work is organized into six-week cycles, which is considered the maximum time frame for meaningful planning and execution, followed by a two-week “cool-down” for teams to work on self-directed projects, fix bugs, or explore new ideas.
- Before committing to a project, a small group of senior people “shape” the work, defining the problem, the appetite (time budget), and the core elements of the solution at a high level of abstraction, but not in high-fidelity detail.
- The output of a shaping session is a “pitch,” a document that clearly outlines the problem, appetite, and solution, which is then presented at a “betting table” where leadership decides which projects to fund for the next cycle.
- Once a project is approved, the team has full autonomy for the six-week cycle to execute the project, with the product manager’s role shifting from a day-to-day project manager to an upstream “shaper” of the work.
- A key technique in shaping is “breadboarding,” which involves creating a diagram of the solution’s components and their connections without getting bogged down in UI details, ensuring technical and product alignment early on.
- Another technique is “fat marker sketching,” which encourages low-fidelity UI mockups to focus on the core concept and flow rather than pixel-perfect details.
- If a team can’t break down a project into nine or fewer major implementation chunks after kickoff, it’s a sign that the work wasn’t shaped well enough and needs to be re-evaluated.
- The Shape Up method is particularly valuable for companies reaching the 30-50 employee mark, where founders can no longer be involved in every decision and a more structured process is needed to maintain shipping cadence.

## Seth Godin

- Marketing is the product. You don't make a product and then do the marketing. The product is the marketing.
- Empathy is not a survey. It's the hard work of figuring out what someone else is going through.
- If you're saying 'you're using it wrong' to your customers, you made a mistake, they did not.
- The thing you ship is not the thing you promised.
- Good intentions are no reason for an extension. The professional doesn't ask for an extension.
- For software as a service, if you don't build the network effect in, you're just a hobby.
- The question is, will this work better for my users if they tell other people about it? If yes, your marketing problems are solved.
- Quality is not luxury or perfection, it's meeting spec. If you meet spec, you're done. If the spec isn't good enough, make a better spec.
- High standards mean you relentlessly improve the spec in service of the people you're working for.
- Don't refuse to ship something that meets spec because you're a perfectionist - that's hiding.
- Delight the person buying the software. If they're not delighted, it doesn't matter what excuses you have.

## Uri Levine

- Product-market fit is the most important thing, and the only metric for it is retention.
- The journey to product-market fit requires a lot of iterations.
- When you lose product-market fit, you need to go back to square one and restart.

## Will Larson

- Foster productive relationships between product managers and engineers by understanding each other’s incentives and needs.
- Promote open communication and collaboration to bridge the gap between different roles within the organization.
- Giving the same performance rating to EMs and PMs.
