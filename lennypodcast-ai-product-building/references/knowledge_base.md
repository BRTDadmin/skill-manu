# Lenny Ai Product Building Knowledge Base

Curated insights from 119 Lenny's Podcast episodes.

## Adam Grenier

- No specific insights on AI & Technology were mentioned in the transcript.

## Adriel Frederick

- When working with algorithmic products, the product manager's role is to define what the algorithm is responsible for versus what people are responsible for, and to create the decision-making framework. Algorithms often fail to grasp long-term effects, user reactions, and the product's core intent.
- There isn't always an algorithmic solution for every problem; operational control and human judgment remain critical.
- NFTs can be used as a technology to provide creators with a public way of acknowledging their rights to digital content, offering a form of IP protection in marketplaces for digital art.

## Albert Cheng

- Yeah, so we’re using AI in a couple of different ways. One is that we’re using it to generate hypotheses. So we have a team of data scientists that are constantly looking at the data and they’re trying to find patterns in the data. And then they’ll come to the growth team and they’ll say, “Hey, we found this interesting pattern. We think that if we do this, then we can increase retention by X percent.” And so that’s one way that we’re using AI. The other way that we’re using AI is that we’re using it to personalize the product. So for example, at Duolingo, we have a bunch of different characters. And so we can use AI to figure out which character is the most effective at teaching you a new language. And so we can personalize the product for each individual user.
- Yeah, so I think the thing that I’m most excited about is just the ability to personalize the product at scale. And so I think we’re still in the very early days of that. And I think that there’s a lot of opportunity to build products that are just much more personalized and much more effective at teaching you new things.

## Alex Hardiman

- Facebook's approach to content was historically binary: content from friends and family, and public content.
- After the 2016 election, they tried to unpack the categories of public content to differentiate factually accurate information from misleading propaganda.
- This was challenging because the platform wasn't built to classify coverage in that way.

## Alex Komoroske

- LLMs are a disruptive technology that changes the basis of competition. They are formed by the distilled intuition of all of society.
- Don't just use LLMs to generate answers. Instead, assume you have magical duct tape and think about what you can now build.
- AI makes us better as individuals by acting as a bicycle for the mind, augmenting our abilities.
- WebSim is an example of a weird, provocative, and generative AI application that is interesting and valuable.

## Amjad Masad

- The scale of AI growth is hard for humans to grasp. If you’re working with AI, get comfortable with exponential change. Don’t just keep doing things the way you’ve always done them. In a year, things will look dramatically different—stay ready to pivot.
- AI might be the future, but it still needs humans to make sure everything runs smoothly.
- “Amjad’s law” and how learning to debug AI-generated code is becoming ever more valuable.

## Andrew Wilkinson

- AI can replace many knowledge work jobs.

## Chamath Palihapitiya

- Algorithms don't understand long-term effects, how people might respond to them, or the intent for the product. It's the product manager's job to figure out what the algorithm should be responsible for.

## Charlie Munger

- Early algorithmic trading strategies were based on simple observations of market trends, like the tendency for prices to follow a trend (up, up or down, down).
- High-frequency trading firms like Renaissance Technologies use immense leverage to generate large returns from small, frequent profits.
- To be a successful investor, you need to have a significant stake in the top-performing companies, like Apple, which was identified as a logical candidate due to its strong market position and reasonable valuation at the time of investment.

## Conor Grennan

- We won't unlock the true power of AI until we change how we think about it.
- Adopting a new mindset and breaking free of an outdated search engine paradigm is crucial for the AI era.
- The problem with AI adoption is not learning how to use the tools, but changing our behavior.
- AI is a partner, and it's learning the language of humans, which will change everything.
- There is no learning curve to large language models; you just do it.
- The use case model of teaching is not effective for AI because it's about a behavioral shift, not just applying technology.
- The commonalities in teaching AI are almost a complete overlap, even between industries, because it's about how humans think.

## Cristina Cordova

- I didn't initially have a lot of conviction that either Palantir or OpenAI would be world-changing. But I had conviction in the founders. - Bob McGrew

## Jules Walter

- Stay informed about major platform shifts, including Web3, AR, VR, and AI, to identify new opportunities.
- Understand the impact of 'micro-changes' in technology, as they can unlock new product possibilities (e.g., WebGL's performance enabling Figma).
- Regularly meet with engineers and domain experts to grasp the nuances and capabilities of new APIs and platforms.

## David Singleton

- I think AI is going to help us to build better products, not just build products faster. So for instance, one of the things that we’re doing at Stripe is we’re using large language models to help our users to understand what’s going on in their businesses. So for instance, we can take the descriptions of charges that are flowing through Stripe and we can use that to classify them into industries. And then we can tell our users, Hey, you’re over-indexed in this particular industry, or you’re under-indexed in this other one. And that’s a really powerful insight that you can then use to go and change your business. So I think we’re going to see a lot more of that kind of thing where AI is not just about making us more efficient, but it’s actually about making our products better.

- Only about 8% of proposed notes meet the quality threshold to be published.
- The Community Notes system is built on transparency, with all code and data being open source and downloadable, allowing for external verification and community-proposed improvements.
- The note-ranking algorithm is based on matrix factorization.
- A 'Supernotes' paper was referenced in the discussion.

## Kevin Weil

- OpenAI’s philosophy of model maximalism is the idea that AI models will improve so quickly that it’s better to build for capabilities that are just emerging rather than extensively scaffolding around current limitations.
- OpenAI structures its AI systems as ensembles of specialized models, similar to how human organizations work, rather than relying on a single general-purpose model.
- Chat as an interface for AI may be the ideal interaction model because its unstructured, flexible nature maximizes communication bandwidth in a way that more structured interfaces cannot.

- AIs are a non-judgemental thought partner, which is valuable. Most of the outputs will be trash (like 80%), but the value is in the process of refining your own thinking.

## Matt Mochary

- When innovating within a large company, create a separate entity (a 'lab') with its own cap table, brand, and board. The parent company acts as a customer and service provider. This structure helps the new venture to stay focused and avoid the parent company's 'antibodies' that can stifle innovation.

## Mike Maples, Jr.

- The value of playing with technology and getting hands-on experience is immense, as it allows for a deeper understanding and intuition about its potential applications and future trajectory.

## Sander Schulhoff

- AI guardrails do not work. If someone is determined enough to trick GPT-5, they're going to deal with that guardrail.
- You can't patch a brain. If you find some bug in your software and you go and patch it, you can be maybe 99.99% sure that bug is solved. Try to do that in your AI system. You can be 99.99% sure that the problem is still there.
- Jailbreaking is when it's just you and the model. Prompt injection occurs when somebody has built an application or sometimes an agent, depending on the situation, on top of a model.
- The only reason there hasn’t been a massive attack yet is how early the adoption is, not because it’s secured.
- With the rise of agents who can take actions on your behalf and AI-powered browsers and student robots, the risk is going to increase very quickly.
- The AI security industry is bullshit.
- The way to get around AI defenses is by separating requests into smaller requests that don't trigger the defenses.
- We've already seen people jailbreaking LM powered robotic systems.
- AI red teaming is the art and science of getting AI systems to do things that they should not do.
- The first and largest data set of prompt injections was collected through a generative AI red teaming competition.
- The paper and the dataset are now used by every single Frontier Lab and most Fortune 500 companies to benchmark their models and improve their AI security.
- The way to solve the AI security problem is to merge classical cybersecurity expertise with AI knowledge.

## Chetan Puttagunta

- As of late 2024, the AI industry is shifting from a pre-training compute approach to test-time compute.
- Understanding the difference between pre-training and test-time compute: Pre-training occurs before testing and involves more complex, resource-intensive computation, whereas test-time compute is typically faster and focuses only on making inferences.
- Moving from pre-training to inference-time is a powerful paradigm shift for the AI industry.
- Test-time compute better aligns the compute and expenditures of the model, relative to pre-training; this is better for the hyperscalers from an efficiency perspective.
- The plateau in pre-training has enabled small teams to catch up to the state-of-the-art models; the proliferation of open source models, specifically what Meta has done with Llama, has been an extraordinary force for AI scaling.
- If the plateau in pre-training continues, small teams will be able to “jump to the frontier” of model training for a specific AI use case; this allows reduces competition amongst the hyperscalers.
- It is likely for two of the Mag7 companies, such as Google and Meta, to give away an AI search product similar to ChatGPT for free.
- OpenAI is “very serious about achieving AGI”; that is the company’s mission, and everything else the company does is in service of that.
- Stability at the model layer will enable optimization at the various layers above it; when the industry is in “land-grab” mode, there is not any time to optimize!
- Over the long-term, technology is deflationary because it is a matter of optimization.
- “I imagine that we’ll be pretty close to or at AGI in 2025.” – Chetan Puttagunta

## Dan Shipper

- AI is viewed as an infrastructure solution rather than just a product layer, with a focus on integrating small AI features incrementally.

## Grace Isford

- In the future, API-first companies will offer something critical but non-core, like payments for e-commerce companies. Tools like Stripe that abstract away the complexity will maintain their dominance across different sectors. - Grace Isford
- There will be more international API-first companies. All the companies featured in my doc are happening internationally in fin-tech, healthcare, data, e-commerce, etc. - Grace Isford
- There will be more API-first companies in the crypto/blockchain space. They will abstract away the complexity of working with blockchain data and making critical but non-core components to work with crypto fin-tech payments. - Grace Isford
- I think crypto and Web3 infrastructure companies will have a massive impact in the future. Vice versa, many Web3 applications and metaverse layers are over-hyped. We see many folks talking about the next consumer app or gaming company atop Web3, which is awesome. But people are not thinking enough about the infrastructure that needs to exist for those companies to happen. - Grace Isford
- It is similar to the early days of the ML stack. A few years ago, I really wanted to invest in ML because I thought it was awesome, cool, and sexy relative to the infrastructure side of things. In many ways, investing in Web3 and metaverse applications are sexier too. Investing in things that leverage decentralized infrastructure and work on the top sounds more exciting. - Grace Isford
- However, I think we will see a point (that we have not quite seen) of Web3 adoption where we need a better crypto developer stack, a crypto data stack, a crypto privacy scaling infrastructure, a reliability stack, and a crypto financial infrastructure stack, among other things. Those are certain examples to enable any of those applications to function and scale to 100M+ users. - Grace Isford
- It reminds me exactly of the data stack in the early days: where everyone wanted to invest in ML companies, but we needed to build the infrastructure and data systems in place to clean, pipe, and transform millions of data points to be leveraged for ML applications at the top. I would double-click on that for anyone building anything in the crypto and Web3 infrastructure space. - Grace Isford

- The demand for engineers will grow as AI unlocks new opportunities for software development.

## Mike Krieger

- 90% of Claude's code is now written by AI, and this has completely transformed how they build products. The bottlenecks have shifted from engineering (writing code) to decision-making (what to build) and merge queues (getting code into production).
- Claude Opus 4 has crossed a critical threshold where it has become a genuine thought partner for strategy.
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) might be the most important thing Anthropic has shipped. It’s already the fastest-growing standard in tech history, with Microsoft integrating it into Windows. The vision: everything becomes an MCP endpoint, making the entire digital world scriptable and composable by AI agents.
- When building AI products, work at the edge of model capabilities and be willing to break things. The best companies using Anthropic’s APIs are those that pushed the limits with earlier models, hit walls, and then were ready when new capabilities emerged.

## Nabeel S. Qureshi

- Palantir built an ontology-first data platform that is well-suited for LLMs.
- Companies that have spent decades building enterprise data foundations have a critical advantage in the AI era due to proprietary data access.

- Trunk-based development is a key technical practice for improving software delivery performance.
- CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is a core DevOps practice that enables frequent and reliable software releases.

## Nicole Forsgren

- AI accelerates coding, but the overall speed of development may not increase as much as expected because of bottlenecks in other parts of the process, like code review and deployment.
- AI can help engineers get into a "flow state" by handling some of the more tedious aspects of coding, allowing them to focus on higher-level problem-solving.
- Engineers need to learn how to trust the code generated by AI, which involves developing new skills in code review and evaluation.
- There's an opportunity to rethink workflows and team structures to take full advantage of AI. For example, more time will be spent on reviewing code versus writing it.
- Senior engineers are creating sophisticated workflows with AI, using agents to design and build different parts of an application. This involves upfront planning and systematic thinking.
- We can't just accept the output of AI models. We need to evaluate it for reliability and style.

- AI companies need to say what's in it for the user and make a remarkable promise they can keep.
- AI can be used as a writing assistant to help brainstorm and perfect the final product.

## Will Larson

- No metric is perfect, and that’s okay. Questions about the validity of metrics are an opportunity to educate people on the nuances of what’s being measured. There is much less nuance in the alternative approach: measuring nothing at all.
- Measuring engineering productivity is hard, but it's important to try.
- The DORA metrics are a good starting point for measuring engineering productivity.
