## Albert Cheng

- Well, that’s very flattering, but I appreciate it. Yeah, I grew up playing a lot of piano. My parents were immigrants from Taiwan, and my parents, even though they weren’t musically proficient, they had a deep love for classical music. So I was the stereotypical Asian kid that was forced to play piano at a very young age. And I still vividly remember we had this upright Yamaha piano, and at the very top of the piano we had this countdown clock that my dad would set for 30 minutes. At first, I really was irritated by that thing, but as I grew older, I started to appreciate music quite a bit more. But I had this unfair advantage, which is that I had perfect pitch, and so I was able to quickly understand whether I was playing the right stuff or the wrong stuff and just learn a lot faster.
- It’s unfair. Definitely. So anyway, yeah, I got quite good as a teenager in high school and even considered going to a conservatory. And to your original point around the relationship between music and growth, I didn’t really reflect on this until recently, but two things came to mind. One is that I think music and growth, they both rely on this just consistent repetition. You’re constantly making mistakes, you’re constantly learning from those mistakes. So that’s a thing that I learned very early, and the second thing that occurred to me is that they both have this structured and unstructured component to it. So for music, you have to learn music theory, you have to learn the fundamentals. But you also need on a day-to-day basis to have creativity, you got to come up with interesting solutions or hypotheses to test. So I think that’s the beautiful combination between the two.

- The venture capital job is learning through doing, and there are many ways to do the job well. You can read a lot and try to become an expert in different thesis areas.

For me, it was a combination of the three. - Grace Isford
- First is leveraging my network - which fortunately was already very strong from the Mayfield fellowship and Stanford networks- in addition to my past internship experiences. - Grace Isford
