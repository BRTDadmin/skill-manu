# Lenny Leadership Management Knowledge Base

Curated insights from 185 Lenny's Podcast episodes.

## Ada Chen Rekhi

- Executive coaching can be valuable for founders to scale themselves alongside their teams.
- It's important to provide constructive feedback.
- When giving feedback, it's important to be specific and provide rationale.

## Adam Grenier

- Improv classes can be a powerful tool for team building, fostering a positive and collaborative culture through the "Yes, and..." principle.
- To develop a new skill within a team, make it a shared goal and establish a system of accountability.

## Adriel Frederick

- A product leader must act as a buffer for their team, managing morale by grounding the team when they are overly optimistic and uplifting them during challenging times or negative press cycles.
- To successfully foster diversity, leadership must genuinely believe in and articulate its business value. When diversity is seen as a core business asset rather than a social obligation, it becomes easier to build a culture that retains and attracts diverse talent.
- Building a team that reflects the diversity of the global user base is a significant competitive advantage. It accelerates decision-making and leads to better product-market fit, as internal debates can surface a wide range of user perspectives without the need for extensive external research.

## Albert Cheng

- I saw some of the highest performers just being people that had very high agency, had that clock speed, had that energy, but they didn’t necessarily need to have deep experience on that matter. A lot of your learned habits actually need to be intentionally discarded.
- Yeah, I think it’s a combination of a few things. One is that you need to have a culture of experimentation. You need to have a culture where it’s okay to fail. The second thing is that you need to have a very clear understanding of what your inputs and outputs are. So for example, at chess.com, our North Star is weekly active users. And then we have a series of input metrics that we think will ladder up to that North Star. So for example, we have the number of games played, we have the number of puzzles played, we have the number of lessons watched. And so we have a team that’s dedicated to each of those input metrics. And then within each of those teams, we have a series of hypotheses that we want to test. And so it’s a combination of having a very clear strategy, having a culture of experimentation, and then having a team that’s dedicated to each of those input metrics.
- I saw some of the highest performers just being people that had very high agency, had that clock speed, had that energy, but they didn’t necessarily need to have deep experience on that matter. A lot of your learned habits actually need to be intentionally discarded. And so what we did at Duolingo was we would hire people from all sorts of different backgrounds. We had people from consulting, we had people from finance, we had people from all sorts of different industries. And we found that the best people were the ones that were just really smart, really hungry, and really wanted to learn.

## Alex Hardiman

- To deal with constant chaos and stress, focus on the small number of important things that must be done and stop doing everything else.
- To retain incredible people, be flexible and accommodating to meet them where they are in their lives.

## Alex Komoroske

- Organizational kayfabe refers to the phenomenon where everyone within an organization pretends that certain false narratives or overly optimistic assessments are true, even when they know they aren’t.
- To avoid organizational kayfabe, encourage radical transparency, create safe spaces for honest feedback, gather real data, and involve team members in brainstorming solutions.
- Adopt a “slime mold” approach to organizational structure by embracing the organic, flexible nature of your organization. Pay attention to ideas that capture interest from diverse groups, iterate on them using feedback, and promote autonomy for innovative exploration.
- Strategy salons” or “nerd clubs” can be powerful tools for generating ideas and fostering innovation. Use them as a safe space to explore half-formed ideas with a few engaged individuals.
- To make reflection a regular habit, create a dedicated space to capture notes, and block out time to review and distill insights.
- When you find yourself explaining the same strategic concept repeatedly in one-on-ones, it's a sign that you should document it and share it more broadly.

## Alisa Cohn

- When delivering tough feedback, use this framework: Start directly, share observations, connect to impact, and focus on the future.
- If someone gets defensive during feedback: Pause the conversation, reinforce positive intent, acknowledge emotions, and offer space.
- A leader’s job is to create conditions for success by setting clear expectations, having difficult conversations, building a culture of accountability, focusing on results, and creating an environment for high performers to thrive.

## Ami Vora

- When having a disagreement, use phrases like “Fascinating! You have to tell me more about why you think that” to show a genuine interest in learning. While everyone loves being right, delivering the best outcome is what truly matters. Put your ego aside, embrace curiosity, and collaborate to broaden your perspective and information set.
- The importance of a good CPO/CEO relationship.
- Vetting heads of product and maintaining customer focus.

## Andrew Wilkinson

- If you have to ask yourself "Should I fire this person?", you should fire them immediately. Superstars are obvious.
- Hire people for what they are, not for what you hope to coach them into.
- Build a business, not a job. Delegate the tasks you hate as quickly as possible.

## Andy Johns

- A high percentage of people in the tech industry (estimated at 70-80%) struggle with mental health issues, ranging from anxiety to more severe conditions. Leaders should be aware of this and create a supportive environment.
- Burnout is a serious issue in the tech industry, and leaders should be proactive in preventing it by promoting a healthy work-life balance and encouraging open conversations about mental health.

## Annie Duke

- Use the “3Ds” framework to make better decisions for your org:
    - Discover: Collect individual opinions independently before group discussion and then share these with everybody prior to the meeting.
    - Discuss: Compare perspectives within the group, focusing on understanding points of disagreement rather than building consensus.
    - Decide: Make decisions independently post-discussion to minimize group influence.
- Incorporate the word “nevertheless” into discussions, especially when making decisions or addressing disagreements. It acknowledges the other person’s perspective while affirming your decision or stance.
- Replace confrontational language like “I disagree” or “you’re wrong” with phrases like “I don’t understand” so everyone feels heard and valued. If people feel heard, they are more likely to feel like they contributed to the decision, even when they disagree.

## Anuj Rathi

- As a leader, there are three reasons why things don't happen: the person can't do (capability), won't do (motivation/alignment), or wasn't set up to do (your fault).

## Arielle Jackson

- No specific points on this topic were found in the provided text.

## Meltem Kuran Berkowitz

- When structuring early growth teams, it's important to have a mix of skills and to empower the team to experiment and learn quickly.
- Building a strong startup culture is essential for attracting and retaining talent, especially in a high-growth environment.

## Bangaly Kaba

- View product management as analogous to coaching a sports team. Just like in sports, not everyone needs to be a star player, but everyone plays a crucial role in achieving success. Similarly, the success of individual team members reflects back on the leader. Investing time and effort into coaching and developing team members not only benefits them but also enhances the leader’s effectiveness in their role.

## Ben Williams

- To resolve tension between teams, it's important to have a shared understanding of the company's vision and mission.
- A clear vision and mission framework can help align teams and guide decision-making.
- A structured growth process with a focus on experimentation can lead to significant impact.
- Learnings from experiments should be seen as a path to impact, not just a collection of data.

## Brad Feld

- Organizational structures often need to change whenever a company doubles in size.
- The specific changes needed during scaling are highly dependent on the individuals within the company.
- CEOs should focus on working *on* the company, rather than *in* the company.
- A useful framework for structuring a company is to think of it as three separate 'machines': the product machine, the customer machine, and the company machine. This helps clarify roles and responsibilities, especially for the CEO.

## Casey Winters

- Functional ops roles can sometimes create silos and slow down decision-making. It's important to have a clear understanding of how these roles will interact with other teams.

## Cassidy Williams

- In a small startup, the CTO's responsibilities can include engineering management, setting up team structure and practices, making technology purchasing decisions, and managing the engineering team.
- Clear division of responsibilities between the CTO and CEO is crucial, with the CEO often handling sales, design, and investor relations while the CTO focuses on the technical side.

## Chamath Palihapitiya

- When evaluating a CEO, the two most important things to solve for are integrity and mental agility.
- Integrity can't be defined by a question; it's about subtle observations over a long period of time.
- Mental agility can be tested with open-ended, seemingly random questions to see how a person frames a problem and connects disparate ideas.
- The best CEOs are incredibly mentally agile, curious, and know a little bit about a lot.

## Charlie Munger

- Building a great partnership requires finding someone with a compatible nature and working together for a long time.
- Successful executive teams often consist of people who have been with the company for their entire careers, as seen at Costco.

## Claire Hughes Johnson

- If you're not sure who the decision-maker is, it's probably you. Act on that to avoid slowing down the company.
- Follow a process, get things done, and make a decision. If you're worried you're not the decision-maker, just ask. Don't get stuck.
- As a company scales, you need to put in a job structure (levels and ladders). It's better to do this proactively before it becomes an emergency and feels inequitable.
- Don't wait until you're 800 people to implement a job structure. It's much harder to categorize people after the fact.
- When scaling, you're always trying to look around the corner and see what's coming next.
- Founders often over-index on their own expertise (e.g., technical founders on engineering, go-to-market founders on sales/marketing). Be self-aware of your gaps and hire for them.
- The book 'Scaling People' is not just for founders, but for any manager or leader in a scaling company who will be asked to do things they've never done before.
- Self-awareness is key for leaders. You have to be willing to say, 'I don't know how to do this,' and ask for help.
- When facing a problem, ask 'Who's done this before? Who can we talk to?' Seek out knowledge and don't assume you have to figure it out yourself.
- Internal communications are incredibly important.
- Run effective meetings.
- To align and make decisions as a manager, use frameworks like S.P.A.D.E.

## Conor Grennan

- Leaders need to help their teams shift their mindset to embrace AI.

## Cristina Cordova

- The founders and early team, nothing matters more than this to me. I'm going to work hard and I want to win, but I can't do it by myself. - Cristina Cordova
- Quality and authenticity of founders have always been the most important thing to me. - Sean Rose, echoed by Cristina Cordova
- The common pattern was an incredibly ambitious goal combined with a credible team.
- They had a learning mindset, and I think they still do. - Cristina Cordova on the Stripe co-founders
- 'Rate of change' and 'clock speed' as a measure of a team's execution ability.

## Dan Hockenmaier

- When you're managing a marketplace, you're like a gardener, not a construction worker. You have to have a very light touch.
- Be very careful when you're messing with the core incentives or mechanisms of a marketplace.

## Jules Walter

- Improve your own product sense by spending time with and learning from people who already possess it.
- Actively participate in product reviews, take detailed notes, and identify patterns in the feedback and questions asked.
- Embrace the philosophy that every detail of the user experience matters, a principle learned from leaders like Stewart Butterfield.

## David Singleton

- Especially for critical roles, leadership hiring in particular, we’re happy to take our time and meet tens or hundreds of candidates before we make a decision on who to hire. And we’re also happy to play the long game. So we’ll meet people who we think are awesome, but maybe the timing isn’t right for them or for us. We’ll keep building the personal relationship with them and oftentimes the moment in time comes when it makes sense for them to join. And by the way, we have an awesome recruiting team, but folks across the rest of the company partner very closely with our recruiting team. Our managers spend a lot of time identifying exactly what they need for the various roles that we have and then getting involved in the process of finding those people and then selling them on the opportunity at Stripe. And then also why it represents a bigger opportunity for them than maybe anything else they can spend their time and attention on.

## Deborah Liu

- For introverted leaders, reframe self-promotion as 'educating' others about the great work your team is doing. This helps secure resources and recognition for your team.
- The best product leaders are those who have faced and overcome adversity. They have the toughest stories and have learned from the hardest feedback.

## Ed Batista

- The impulse to hurry, especially under stress, is often a mistaken signal and can lead to mistakes. It's a signal to slow down.
- To counter the impulse to hurry, one can expand self-awareness, employ in-the-moment tactics, and build emotional regulation capacity over time.
- Self-awareness involves understanding the conditions (people, time of day) that trigger a sense of urgency and recognizing one's own physiological responses to stress.
- A specific tactic is cognitive reappraisal or reframing: challenging the assumptions and stories we tell ourselves to explain a situation.
- Talking about feelings is a reliable way to manage them more effectively. This requires a culture where it's acceptable to discuss emotions.
- Foundational practices for emotion regulation are essential for managing the impulse to hurry.

## Elena Verna

- Growth teams in the AI era should be composed of full-stack generalists who can work across the entire funnel, rather than specialists working in silos.
- Fostering a strong culture of experimentation, where failure is accepted, is crucial for a successful growth team.

## Elias Torres

- Hire for hunger and grit over credentials. Give people from humble backgrounds a chance and test their intelligence and drive.
- Role model what becoming an outlier really means to help exceptional people grow.
- When scaling, you need to rebuild the team, not just the product.
- At Drift, scaling to 800 people led to a loss of customer intimacy.

## Esther Crawford

- Bureaucracy, silos, and power plays can stifle innovation and demoralize top performers.
- A bloated management structure can be a symptom of accommodating career growth rather than focusing on efficiency.
- A culture that is too soft and entitled can lead to a lack of accountability and a resistance to healthy debate and criticism.
- It is crucial to have a streamlined process for decision-making and approvals to avoid unnecessary delays and frustration.
- Leadership's conviction in their own plan is essential for employee morale and confidence in the company's future.
- A culture of fear can quickly develop when a leader's mood and reactions are unpredictable.
- A leader's inner circle should not be so zealous and fanatical that they are unwilling to challenge ideas.
- A leader's gut instinct should be balanced with data and expertise from the team.

## Ethan Evans

- True leaders should actively work to challenge their assumptions. Keeping an open mind and demonstrating the ability to change your beliefs broadens your perspective, leading to faster and better decision-making.
- Recovering from failure is easier than you think. Own the mistake, learn from it, and work relentlessly to regain trust. Even after a failed public launch at Amazon, Ethan regained Jeff Bezos’s trust and got promoted.

## Ethan Mollick

- Leaders need to have a clear vision for how AI will be integrated into the organization and communicate it to their teams.
- Incentives are crucial for encouraging AI adoption. Examples include cash prizes for automation or requiring teams to explore AI solutions before hiring or starting new projects.
- If a company has a history of using technology to cut jobs, it will be harder to get buy-in for AI adoption.
- Leaders should be transparent about the potential impact of AI on jobs.

## Fatima Dicko

- Everyone is either an 'Einstein' (depth-oriented) or a 'da Vinci' (breadth-oriented). It is okay to be a da Vinci as long as you find Einsteins for the different pillars you are interested in.
- Focus on your strengths and making them better, rather than focusing on your weaknesses and trying to improve them.
- When you hire someone to fill a weakness, you should feel like you can back off and not want to jump in. That's a sign of a good hire.

## Flo Crivello

- AI agents are starting to replace entire teams in startups, particularly in sales and outreach.

## Gagan Biyani

- Disagreements over company values and leadership style can lead to the departure of a co-founder.
- Rebuilding a relationship with a former co-founder is possible through open communication and a shared commitment to the company's success.

## Gayle Laakmann McDowell

- The hiring process is flawed, but algorithmic interviews are often the "least bad" option for assessing candidates.
- Interview questions that can be solved with a "trick" are not good questions because they test for preparation, not problem-solving ability.
- When hiring, companies are not just looking for someone to do the current job, but someone who can grow and adapt for future roles.
- The goal of algorithmic interviews is to assess a candidate's problem-solving skills, their ability to tackle unfamiliar problems, and their communication skills, not just their intelligence or knowledge of a specific algorithm.

## Gib Biddle

- Being a 'feedback freak' and constantly seeking feedback is a key trait of successful leaders.

## Guillermo Rauch

- A key operating principle at Vercel is 'increasing exposure hours,' which encourages team members to spend more time observing how customers use their products to build empathy and develop better solutions.

## Gustaf Alstromer

- Hiring is the most important thing for a startup.
- Hire people who are excited to be there and understand their true motivations.
- Culture interviews are important to ensure new hires map to the company's core values.
- Hiring people from diverse backgrounds, including former founders, can be very beneficial.
- It's important for co-founders to understand each other's motivations for starting the company. This helps with conflict resolution.
- A good question to ask in office hours is 'Why are you doing this?'. The answer should be deeper than just 'I found a niche in the market'.

## Itamar Gilad

- The best founders and leaders create an environment where they empower their teams to find evidence and challenge their ideas, rather than just dictating what to build.
- To effectively push back on leaders or founders, come with hard data and evidence from experiments, prototypes, or user studies, rather than just opinions.
- A product manager's role is to be a facilitator and enabler for the team, protecting them and creating an environment for them to do their best work.

## Ivan Zhao

- Notion prioritized building robust systems over increasing headcount, which allowed them to maintain a small and focused team.
- The company achieved unicorn status with only a few dozen employees.
- A lean-team approach resulted in faster decision-making, a more cohesive company culture, and the ability to iterate on the product quickly.
- Ivan has expressed a preference for hiring 'misfits,' indicating a value for unconventional talent and diverse perspectives.

## Jan Chong

- Focus on what’s keeping your manager up at night. Often people are so focused on solving their own problems, they don’t think about how their proposed solutions create more problems one level up.

## Jeff Weinstein

- Empowering teams with a single metric.
- Diversity and team building.
- Building new products within a large company.

## Jen Abel

- The founder is the best salesperson in the early days because they have the deepest understanding of the vision and product.
- Hiring a salesperson too early is a common mistake; founders should lead sales initially.
- Founder-led sales brings accountability closer to the pulse of where decisions are made.

## Jeremy Henrickson

- Maintaining velocity at scale: Break down large problems into smaller pieces and give them to small, focused teams.
- An example of small teams with clear missions: At Rippling, they created a new business unit by giving a single engineer a small team and a clear mission.
- Rippling’s unique culture of fast decision-making: They have a "disagree and commit" culture, which allows them to make decisions quickly and move on.
- Rippling’s leadership values: They value people who are "in the weeds" and understand the details of the product.
- Advice for cultivating fast-decision-making teams: Hire people who are comfortable with ambiguity and are willing to make decisions with incomplete information.
- How deep-level thinking and working on the ground helped Rippling expand to other countries: By understanding the local market and regulations, they were able to launch in new countries quickly and successfully.
- Lessons from working with a founder who has strong opinions about what the product should be: It's important to have a healthy debate, but at the end of the day, you need to be able to commit to a decision and move forward.

## Jessica Lachs

- To build a high-impact analytics organization, consider the trade-offs between centralized and decentralized team structures.
- Foster a culture of extreme ownership within the data team.
- When hiring data analysts, test for curiosity by including flaws in case studies to see if candidates notice and how they respond.
- The best data analysts are those who can form a point of view with incomplete information and are able to pivot when new information becomes available.
- Encourage cross-functional roles to broaden the experience and impact of the data team.
- When managing a global data organization, it's important to build diverse and skilled teams.

## Jessica Livingston

- Technical team members need to have a voice in companies involving tech.

## Jiaona Zhang

- As a product manager, you are not the CEO of the product; your power comes from your ability to influence without direct authority.
- To effectively convince leadership of a different path, it's crucial to first understand the 'why' behind their directives and then to propose a superior, well-reasoned alternative.
- Building a high-performing team is founded on trust, which is the bedrock of collaboration, risk-taking, and psychological safety.

## John Cutler

- The most effective leaders create an environment of psychological safety where team members feel comfortable taking risks and sharing their ideas.
- Investing in people and their growth is a key responsibility of leadership.
- Leaders must be able to clearly communicate the 'why' behind the work to motivate and align their teams.
- A culture of learning and experimentation is crucial for continuous improvement and innovation.
- The pyramid of leadership self-awareness consists of three levels: self-awareness, other-awareness, and situational awareness.

## John Mark Nickels

- Conscious leadership involves becoming more aware of your interior world—your thoughts, emotions, and biases.
- Everyone has influence, regardless of their formal role or title.
- Take responsibility for how you impact those around you by asking yourself daily, “How am I influencing others?”
- While optics matter, don’t let them overshadow the work itself. Focus on delivering value and making an impact.
- The best presentations are grounded in genuine passion for the work, not just flashy slides.

## Jonathan Becker

- When hiring for paid growth roles, prioritize candidates with extensive hands-on experience, as much of the learning comes from doing.
- Cultural fit is also essential, especially for collaborative teams.
- Small companies can benefit from hiring an agency to access expertise at a lower cost.
- Large companies may prefer to build an in-house team for greater control over the process.

## Julia Schottenstein

- An offsite exercise Julia used to help her team internalize upcoming changes
- Lessons from working with strongly opinionated users

## Julie Zhuo

- AI will make everyone a manager. The same skills used to manage people will be essential for managing AI agents.
- Three core manager skills that translate to managing AI are: 1. Defining the goal and outcome with crystal clarity. 2. Understanding the strengths of your resources (people or AI agents) to use the right tools for the right purposes. 3. Assembling the “Avengers” - putting together the right team with the right skills.
- The role of a manager is to manage change, and the rate of change is accelerating.
- The future of management roles might see a dissolution of traditional role boundaries (engineer, PM, designer) and a move towards calling everyone “builders.”
- Management is still critical for providing a North Star and a vision.
- It is a manager’s job to build a great team and create processes for them to work well together.

## Karri Saarinen

- The founding team is strongly aligned on the values of craft and quality, which is reflected in the company culture.
- The company believes in a unified culture and avoids having multiple, conflicting subcultures.
- Employees are given ownership of their projects and the space to do their best work.
- The hiring process focuses on finding people who are passionate about the product and problem space, not just filling a specific role.
- A paid, one-week work trial is used to assess a candidate's fit with the team and their "product sense."

## Kayvon Beykpour

- To change a stagnant product culture, focus on building alignment at the leadership level, telling a compelling vision and strategy story repeatedly, and hiring entrepreneurial founders through acquihires to take big bets.
- Identify who is 'on the wagon' (bought into the vision) versus 'off the wagon' and be swift in making organizational changes.
- Building a new product from scratch (0 to 1) is extremely difficult if the entire team isn't bought into the vision. People who are 'off the wagon' need to either get on board or leave.

## Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter

- Small, focused teams with a single clear owner, 100% dedicated members, and freedom from standard corporate processes can have an outsized impact.
- The project's survival and success through multiple CEO changes highlights the importance of demonstrating value and aligning with the company's mission.

## Kevin Aluwi

- I think that a lot of literature out there says that product teams should be this communal best ideas come from everywhere group, which I think is well-intentioned and absolutely everyone should contribute ideas, but I think not having it be super clear who is accountable and who is deciding often slows down execution a lot.
- The value of founders doing and understanding multiple roles within the company. I think it's incredibly important for founders to have done a lot of the roles in the company themselves... because you just develop a much deeper appreciation for the challenges and the nuances of each of those roles.

## Kevin Weil

- OpenAI maintains velocity through a strongly bottom-up approach to product development, empowering teams to move quickly without extensive consensus-seeking.
- OpenAI values planning over plans, and accepts that mistakes will happen when moving quickly. Their approach emphasizes ownership, autonomy, and the ability to learn and pivot rapidly.
- When hiring product managers, OpenAI looks for high agency and comfort with ambiguity.

## Kevin Yien

- Before you present an offer to a hiring candidate, send them an “unsell email” that lists all the reasons why they may not want to work at your company. This helps candidates better understand the role and addresses their concerns.
- Don’t be discouraged if candidates decline your offer after the 'unsell email' - you’ll save time and money down the line by preventing early employee turnover.

## Kim Scott

- Radical Candor is a framework for providing feedback that involves caring personally and challenging directly at the same time.
- The four quadrants of the Radical Candor framework are: Radical Candor, Obnoxious Aggression, Ruinous Empathy, and Manipulative Insincerity.
- Obnoxious Aggression is what happens when you challenge directly but don't care personally. It's being a jerk.
- Ruinous Empathy is what happens when you care personally but don't challenge directly. This is the most common mistake people make.
- Manipulative Insincerity is what happens when you neither care personally nor challenge directly.
- When giving feedback, it is important to state your intention to be helpful.
- Feedback should be given immediately, not delayed.
- Feedback should be delivered synchronously, with a preference for phone calls over video calls.
- Praise should be given in public, while criticism should be delivered in private.
- Feedback should focus on behavior, not personality.
- Managers should have regular career conversations with their direct reports.
- To solicit feedback effectively, ask, 'What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?' instead of the generic, 'Do you have any feedback for me?'.
- When receiving feedback, listen to understand, not to respond, and reward the candor.

## Kunal Shah

- Indian tech CEOs often emulate Rama’s values by prioritizing principles from the founders of their companies over personal interests. Satya Nadella is given as an example.

## Lane Shackleton

- "Tag ups" are used at Coda instead of traditional 1-on-1s. They are more focused on specific topics and can involve multiple people, making them more efficient and effective.
- Coda has a "Tim Ferriss Day" where employees are encouraged to experiment with new ideas and work on projects outside of their regular responsibilities. This fosters a culture of innovation and creativity.

## Laura Modi

- A strong company culture is fundamental to success. It influences hiring, daily operations, and overall team energy.
- Effective leadership involves maintaining high energy and motivation within the team, even for mundane projects, through powerful storytelling.
- Building personal relationships with team members is vital, even in a remote environment. A balance between a 'family-like' and a transactional work culture is optimal.

## Lauryn Isford

- A culture that prioritizes customer impact over just metrics can be built by creating alternative ways to motivate, reward, and retain talent. 
- The leader of a growth team should encourage a culture of rigor and precision in problem-solving, not just a culture of experimentation. 
- It is important for leaders to create a culture where it is safe to not run experiments and instead focus on what is right for the customer.

## Lulu Cheng Meservey

- Make mistakes of commission rather than omission. Mistakes of commission can be observed and learned from, while mistakes of omission allow the status quo to win.
- The analogy for taking risks is investing in the market (commission) versus sitting on cash (omission).

## Madhavan Ramanujam

- The good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both.

## Madhavan Ramanujam

- Pricing needs to be a cross-functional effort, with product, marketing, sales, and finance all involved.

## Manik Gupta

- The CPO role has evolved from being focused on product execution to being a strategic partner to the CEO, involved in all aspects of the business.
- Working at Google is like being in a 'candy store' with many opportunities, Uber is a 'rocket ship' with a fast-paced environment, and Microsoft is a large, established company with a more structured approach.

## Marc Benioff

- Never lose sight of the “beginner’s mindset”—always building, learning, and evolving.
- In a crowded market, you’re forced to innovate and evolve, but when you’re alone, stagnation can set in. Embrace your competitors, learn from them, and strive to get better each day.
- Toyota’s philosophy—“Better, better, better, never best”—perfectly captures this spirit: never stop improving, no matter how good you get.

## Marty Cagan

- The primary role of a leader is to create an environment where product teams can thrive, providing them with autonomy, resources, and protection from distractions.
- Servant leadership is the most effective model for leading product teams, where the leader's focus is on serving the team's needs.
- Leaders are responsible for holding teams accountable for outcomes, not for dictating solutions.

## Matt Abrahams

- When giving feedback, use the 'What? So What? Now What?' structure or the 'Four I’s' (information, impact, invitation, implications) to provide a complete and effective response.
- Strive for connection over perfection in communication with your team.
- Listen actively and show genuine curiosity in conversations to make team members feel valued.

## Matt LeMay

- The success of a team hinges on the effective collaboration of individuals with diverse perspectives and ideas.
- A key responsibility of a leader is to articulate the collective impact of the team's work on the business.
- Encourage open communication and embrace constructive disagreement to foster a healthy and productive team environment.

## Matt MacInnis

- Deliberately understaff projects to force creativity and prevent bloat from politics and bureaucracy. The sweet spot is uncomfortable but productive tension.
- Good teams get tired; great teams run in the red constantly and destroy good teams in that moment.
- The job of a leader is to preserve intensity and fight entropy. Teams will naturally optimize for local comfort and disorder, so executives must demand 99% energy levels daily, or the system decays.
- Withholding negative feedback is selfish because you prioritize your own comfort over making teammates and the company better.
- The best executives can be thrown into any situation and bring order to chaos.
- Top 10% performers don’t get 10% more rewards; they get 10-100x the rewards.

## Matt Mochary

- When firing someone, the most critical element is to deliver the news one-on-one, directly from their manager. Avoid impersonal methods like email or group chats, as they are dehumanizing and can cause anger and resentment.
- To handle layoffs humanely, inform each person individually, use a script, acknowledge their contributions, allow them to express their emotions, and offer a generous severance package.
- Recognize that fear provides poor guidance. When feeling fearful, avoid making decisions. Instead, discuss the situation with someone for an external perspective and test your fears with low-stakes decisions to see that fear is often an unreliable predictor of outcomes.
- Anger is destructive to relationships. If you feel angry, pause and refrain from acting until you have calmed down. A useful phrase for others to use is, 'You seem to be in anger right now,' to help you recognize your emotional state.
- To ensure people feel heard, use the 'Clearing' process, where one person speaks without interruption while the other listens and then reflects back what they understood.
- Identify your single most important 'Top Goal' and schedule dedicated time in your calendar to work on it. Use an accountability partner to maintain consistency.

## Matthew Dicks

- Use storytelling to build confidence in team members.

- Disagreeing with someone might seem confrontational, but it builds trust when done constructively. When you’re in a meeting or discussing ideas, don’t be afraid to voice your differing opinion. Just make sure it’s backed by thoughtful reasoning and clarity on assumptions.
- Just as founders inject energy into their startups, you need to find what drives your passion and energy. Is it dissatisfaction with the status quo? Is it a rivalry, or a desire to build something better? Understanding your source of energy can help you remain motivated through challenges and lead your business with conviction.

- The mantra 'We might be wrong, but we are not confused' is critical for team alignment. It means that once a direction is chosen, everyone must commit to it fully to create a chance for success, as a lack of unified effort guarantees failure. (Tomer Cohen)
- Leaders should prioritize clarity and focus over being right. It's better to move forward in a unified direction, even if it proves wrong, than to hedge and achieve mediocre results. (Tomer Cohen)
- Foster a culture where it is safe and even encouraged to be wrong. This liberates team members to present strong, debatable opinions, which are necessary for productive Socratic conversations. (Tomer Cohen)
- Actively distinguish between team members disagreeing with a strategy versus misunderstanding it. Misunderstandings require clarification, while disagreements require a real debate. (Tomer Cohen)
- Ensure that strategic priorities are directly reflected in resource allocation. A priority without dedicated resources is not a priority at all. (Tomer Cohen)
- A leader must ensure that meetings end with clear decisions and no ambiguity. It's a failure if team members leave unsure of what was decided. (Tomer Cohen)

## Vijay Iyengar

- Engineers often develop a 'scar tissue' and an instinct to say 'no' to new ideas because they bear the maintenance cost of poorly conceived features. Leaders should encourage them to first explore how an idea *could* work before rejecting it.
- To get to a 'no' responsibly, one should first sincerely try to make 'yes' work and document the reasons why it's not feasible. This builds a stronger case and fosters a more collaborative environment.
- In a crisis, such as 40% revenue churn, radical focus is required. This can mean throwing away existing roadmaps and giving teams extreme clarity on a single goal, like fixing the top reasons for churn.
- Don't relegate talented design teams to simply applying a visual polish at the end of a project. Involve them strategically from the beginning and give them the space to work on foundational system-level design.
- It can be incredibly painful organizationally to cut 'mildly successful' products, as teams are invested and have their own roadmaps. This decision should be made with careful consideration of the long-term strategic cost.

## Vikrama Dhiman

- Three key traits of a great PM to work with: 1. Raise difficult issues without being difficult. 2. Bring up important topics without drawing importance to yourself. 3. Focus on getting decisions made, not making them yourself.

- Intent alone is not enough; it must be paired with execution and impact.

## Yuhki Yamashita

## Anneka Gupta

- Navigating “founder mode” dynamics in organizations is a key skill for product leaders.
- When dealing with challenging colleagues, approach them with curiosity rather than frustration. Understand their motivations to align your goals with theirs.
- To give effective feedback: Explicitly communicate that you care about the person’s success, be direct and specific about the issue and its impact, offer concrete examples and suggestions for improvement, and frame feedback in terms of perception when appropriate.
- When you have to change out your direct reports, it can be a scary and challenging situation. Reframing your thinking to find the 'fun' in it can help you get through it.
- As a leader, you can't always lead someone somewhere by just asking questions. You also have to be willing to share your own perspective and hypothesis.
- When sharing your perspective, be mindful that people might just agree with you because of your position. Seed an assumption and then have a discussion around it.

## Annie Pearl

## Brian Rothenberg

- When building a growth team, a cross-functional model is often more effective than housing it within a single function like marketing, as it prevents functional leaders from being overly protective of their domains.
- To get buy-in for a new growth team, position it as a limited-time experiment (e.g., a six-month test) focused on a specific, high-potential opportunity.
- Build momentum for the growth team by securing and showcasing early wins, and use tactics like cross-functional learning sessions to ingrain a testing and experimentation DNA into the company culture.
- Effective leadership for a growth program requires focusing on the process that produces results, not just the results themselves. Failure is a key part of the process.
- It's important for team members to understand not only their own roles but also the roles of others on the team and how they are all interconnected.

## Brie Wolfson

- The fundamental building block of any company is the individual. Empowered individual contributors are becoming increasingly important, especially with the rise of AI.

- While the tactics of company building may change, the core principles remain the same: building a great team, creating a great product, and having a clear mission.

- It's important to be mindful of the distinction between a "thinking" culture and a "doing" culture. Both are necessary, but the balance needs to be right.
- Morale and fun are not frivolous; they are essential for a healthy and productive team. Leaders should actively work to amplify the energy and passion of their team members.

- To be a great product leader or leader in general in any industry is to be a great storyteller.
- When you start with you first at the center of the equation, it's much more powerful because it's not selfish, it empowers us to connect with others so that we can bring it to life.

- To calm your nervous system, breathe into your stomach and ensure that the exhale is twice as long as the inhale. One example is to inhale slowly through your nose for a count of four, hold your breath for four counts, and then exhale slowly through your nose for eight counts. In doing so, you activate the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to a calming effect on the body and mind.
- Humming can further enhance the calming effect. After the deep breathing exercises, try humming through your nose during the exhale. This not only aids in relaxation but also has potential benefits like releasing nitric oxide and reducing eye tension.
- To excite your nervous system, breathe into your upper chest in a shallow and rapid manner. In doing so, you activate the sympathetic nervous system, leading to an increase in adrenaline and cortisol.

## Ken Norton

- The majority of challenges for senior executives are people-related, not product-related.
- Servant leadership, metaphorically described as 'bringing the donuts,' means filling in gaps and doing whatever is necessary to support the team.
- In a remote work environment, the digital equivalent of 'bringing the donuts' can be as simple as sending DoorDash codes for actual donuts to team members.
- Leaders have a responsibility to address and dismantle systemic issues that contribute to imposter syndrome, rather than simply telling individuals to 'deal with it.'
- There are two primary mindsets in leadership: Creative and Reactive. The Reactive mindset is driven by fear, focuses on problems, and conforms to expectations, seeking external validation. The Creative mindset is driven by purpose and vision, focuses on outcomes, and leads with intention, seeking internal validation.
- There are three types of reactive tendencies: Complying (people-pleasing, seeking harmony), Protecting (maintaining distance, being critical or cynical), and Controlling (driving for results, being autocratic or perfectionistic).
- To shift from a reactive to a creative mindset, one must identify their reactive tendencies and the underlying beliefs that drive them.
- Instead of asking, 'What problem do I need to solve?', one should ask, 'What do I want to create?'.
- Leadership can be categorized as 'Above the Line' (conscious, creative) or 'Below the Line' (unconscious, reactive).

- When recruiting top talent, involve the entire executive team. It shows the candidate they are a priority.
- Personalize the recruiting process. Involve the candidate's spouse and family in the decision-making process.

## Mihika Kapoor

- Figma implements a fun “hot seat” tradition, where each person takes turns being in the hot seat for a set amount of time. During their turn, the person can be asked anything by the other members of the group. By understanding what motivates each team member and building strong relationships, collaboration becomes more effective.
- Make time for fun! “Play” is one of Figma’s core values. When people have fun together, they get to know each other more deeply and can feel more appreciated within the group. One tradition Mihika’s team uses is “The Figgies,” where they give out absurd awards.

## Nabeel S. Qureshi

- Palantir screens for independent-minded, intellectually curious, and highly competitive people.
- Palantir intentionally avoids traditional titles and career ladders to reduce internal competition and politics, forcing recognition based on merit and impact rather than position.

- Looking for signs like athletic achievements or chess playing can predict work ethic and problem-solving abilities better than traditional credentials.
- Palantir’s controversial “bat signal” recruiting strategy filtered for specific talent types.
- A two-page plan for projects, including vision, goals, and tactics, reviewed by smart people who don't have context on the project, is a useful process.

- A classic problem with early managers is extending offers to candidates who are not a good fit.
- Another problem is not having enough candidates in the pipeline.
