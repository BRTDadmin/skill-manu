# Lenny's Leadership & Management Playbook

Curated leadership insights from 185 Lenny's Podcast episodes featuring executives from Stripe, Meta, Google, Netflix, Airbnb, and more.

## Core Principles

### Team Building
- **Diversity as competitive advantage**: Teams reflecting global user diversity accelerate decision-making and improve product-market fit.
- **Give away your Legos**: As you scale, delegate responsibilities you love to develop others and focus on higher-leverage work.
- **Culture interviews**: Assess cultural fit alongside skills to build cohesive teams.

### Hiring Excellence
- **The 'Who' method**: Focus on past behaviors and specific examples rather than hypotheticals.
- **Candidate-market fit**: Match candidates to the specific challenges and stage of your company.
- **Hire for slope, not intercept**: Prioritize learning ability and growth potential over current skills.

### Feedback & Communication
- **Radical Candor** (Kim Scott): Care personally while challenging directly.
- **Specific + rationale**: When giving feedback, be specific and explain the reasoning.
- **Most charitable interpretation**: Assume positive intent when receiving feedback.

### 1:1s & Performance
- **1:1s are for them**: Use 1:1 time for coaching, career development, and removing blockers—not status updates.
- **Disagree and commit**: Once a decision is made, fully commit even if you disagreed.
- **Traffic light system**: Use red/yellow/green to quickly communicate project status.

### Scaling Organizations
- **Look around the corner**: Anticipate what needs to be in place in 6 months to avoid crises.
- **If you're not sure who the decision-maker is, it's probably you**: Act on decisions to avoid slowing down the company.
- **Blueprint for leaders**: Create operating systems that scale beyond individual heroics.
