What are they getting out of the products as they are today and what are the problems adjacent to the ones that we’re already solving for them? And when we find that confluence of kind of need and then adjacency to what we’re already doing, that’s usually our invitation to go and build something new.

- Maintaining a positive relationship with co-founders is crucial, even after professional disagreements and separation.
- Biyani was fired from Udemy, the company he co-founded, due to disagreements with his co-founder about the direction of the company.
- After being fired, Biyani made a conscious effort to not speak negatively about the company or his former co-founder to avoid damaging the company's reputation.

- The motivation to start a company can change over time to just running the company.
- It's hard to screen for motivation in interviews. It's better to help founders discover it themselves.
- Founders surprisingly often have not talked about why they are doing this.
- A good reason *not* to start a company is if you think of it as a career step.
- Startups are hard, much harder than a normal job, regardless of success or failure.

## Itamar Gilad

- Even visionary founders like Steve Jobs didn't just have a perfect idea from the start. The iPhone's creation was a messy process of discovery, trial and error, and prototypes. The founder's role is often to be the 'editor-in-chief' who curates and champions the best ideas as evidence emerges.
- The first steps to becoming more evidence-guided are to admit you have a problem, start small with a single project, be patient, and celebrate small wins.

## Ivan Zhao

- Don't be afraid to start over. The Notion team made the difficult decision to scrap their initial product and rebuild it from the ground up.
- The primary focus should be on building a great product that people love, rather than chasing early publicity or fundraising.
- Ivan's philosophy is that 'If you build something great, the network will come and investors will say yes.'
- Notion went through a period of three to four 'lost years' before finding product-market fit.
- The company was initially funded by a loan from Ivan's mother.
- At one point, the founders laid off their entire team of five and relocated to Kyoto to work 18-hour days, fully dedicated to rebuilding the product.
- Ivan's advice to other entrepreneurs is to 'Reset and start again if you need to.'

## Jacqueline Jensen

- The biggest opportunity for improvement in most sales processes is qualification.
- It's a game of telephone when a salesperson is between the founder and the customer.

## Jessica Hische

- Startups should begin with a 'good enough' logo and focus on product development rather than investing heavily in a perfect brand identity from the outset.
- A custom logo and typography can be a valuable investment for a successful company to prevent copycats from tricking customers, as free or common fonts are easily replicable.

## Jessica Livingston

- When evaluating early-stage investments, you need to assess the founders and their social dynamics, not just the idea.
- Early-stage ideas are bound to change many times, but the people will remain the same.
- How co-founders interact: Pay close attention to interpersonal dynamics during interviews. Green flags include signs of mutual respect and collaboration. Red flags include one founder dominating conversations or preventing their co-founder from speaking.
- Domain expertise: Look for founders who are solving a problem they deeply understand and are passionate about.
- Earnestness and authenticity: Earnestness shows up in practice through humility, honesty, and transparency—admitting when you don’t know something, and not trying to reframe or avoid tough questions.
- Attitude toward feedback: Founders who are defensive or closed off during discussions may indicate challenges with receiving feedback or collaboration. Look for openness and adaptability in how founders respond to questions and challenges.
- Commitment and passion: Founders who convey genuine passion and energy for their ideas can often sway investors, even if the initial concept is met with skepticism. Assess if founders are genuinely passionate about their idea and willing to commit fully (e.g. quitting their job, relocating). Having that “desperation” of needing the startup to succeed because you don’t have a plan B is important for driving commitment.
- Relentless resourcefulness: The ability to find creative solutions and make things happen even with limited resources or knowledge. This determination and scrappiness is crucial.
- Defensiveness is a big red flag in founders.
- YC’s lack of experience in investing actually led them to discover their signature “batch” model. Don't be afraid of inexperience.
- Watch out for signals that a company has a “hacker in a cage.” This is when a business founder has clearly convinced someone technical to join the team, only to give them very little equity and very little say in the direction of the product.

## Jiaona Zhang

- When you disagree with a founder's direction, the most effective approach is not to simply say 'no,' but to deeply understand their vision and then propose a better, more scalable way to achieve their ultimate goal.

## John Mark Nickels

- Lessons from working at Uber, Waymo, and DoorDash.

- The project had a humble beginning, starting with a 'dumpster fire GIF'.

## Kevin Aluwi

- In the early days of Gojek, there was a lot of resistance to our services. The most common form of that resistance in the early days was actually by motorcycle taxi mafia... But instead, we actually hired private security... And so we actually ran a fairly big private security operation for a fairly long time.
- Tips on building a tech company outside of Silicon Valley. I think the number one thing is to just be really intellectually honest about what are the pros and cons of your market... And then the second thing is to just be really aware of the talent landscape.

## Madhavan Ramanujam

## Matt MacInnis

- You know when you have product-market fit; if you don’t absolutely know if you have PMF, then you don’t have it.
- The notion of “never quit” is complete VC bullshit. The incentive of the VC is to plow money into your company and milk you dry. Know when to quit; achieving PMF is insane and exciting – don’t spend your limited time on earth forcing something that won’t ever achieve product-market fit.
- A company should probably call it quits around the second or third pivot, which tends to occur around year four.
- View your startup as running an experiment in the universe and seeing what you get in return for doing so. The goal is to find out if the universe has the binding receptors to accept what you are building or not; if those binding receptors don’t exist, quit and do something else.

## Matt Mochary

- Even the most successful founders grapple with fear, including fear of failure, inadequacy, and disappointing others.

- Don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many people who have been through the same challenges you're facing and are willing to share their knowledge and experience.
- The most successful founders are those who are able to build a strong team and delegate effectively. You can't do everything yourself.

## Nancy Duarte

## Oji Udezue and Ezinne Udezue

- The way to avoid a drunken startup walk is to pick a sharp problem.

- If you can bootstrap, even for a funded idea, do it for as long as possible to de-risk the business and get to a better valuation.

## Paul Adams

- For startups, a 20-year vision is likely too long; a 6-year vision is more appropriate.
- A 6-month timeline is a significant amount of time in a startup's life, in which a lot can be built and shipped.

## Paul Millerd

- The 'pathless path' is not just for entrepreneurs; it can also be for people who are looking to find more meaning and purpose in their work, even within a traditional company.

- Angel investing is more about people and luck than analytics.
- The surprising parts of angel investing are how much it's about people, luck, and giving back.

## Sam Lessin

- For founders, etiquette is a crucial skill for building relationships with investors, partners, and early employees.
- Founders should not underestimate the importance of social skills in the success of their startup.
- Projecting an aura of abundance, not scarcity, is key when fundraising and networking.
- Don't be abrasive on purpose, even if it's part of the Silicon Valley stereotype.

## Sam Schillace

- The story of Writely (which became Google Docs) demonstrates the viability of building a successful company by identifying a gap in the market and creating a product that offers a significantly better user experience, even if it seems like a 'toy' at first.

- Don't wait too long to start experimenting with paid channels, as it can be a powerful engine for growth.

## Tobi Lütke

- Just as founders inject energy into their startups, you need to find what drives your passion and energy. Is it dissatisfaction with the status quo? Is it a rivalry, or a desire to build something better? Understanding your source of energy can help you remain motivated through challenges and lead your business with conviction.
- If you’re feeling scared to launch something, reframe it as an experiment. Take the pressure off yourself and simply focus on learning. By lowering the emotional stakes, you’ll be able to take risks and move faster without letting fear hold you back.

- When building a two-sided marketplace, a key strategic advantage is to build tools that provide utility to the supply side even before there is significant demand. This helps engage and retain suppliers.
- A simpler, scalable operational approach (like Thumbtack's large manual data team) can be more effective than a complex, over-engineered technical solution (like SkillSlate's web crawlers).
- Building a 'better mousetrap' on an existing, validated market model (like Thumbtack did with the ServiceMagic model) can lead to faster product-market fit than trying to create an entirely new market behavior (like TaskRabbit's peer-to-peer model).
- Horizontal platforms are powerful for capturing the long-tail of a market early on but are vulnerable to more focused, vertical competitors who offer a superior, specialized solution.
- The most successful new marketplaces often start by dominating a small, seemingly niche market and then expand outward into adjacent, larger markets (e.g., Airbnb starting with air mattresses).

## Brie Wolfson

- The concept of "Founder Mode" from Paul Graham is about the intense focus and dedication required to get a startup off the ground.

## Camille Ricketts

- This was the first very small startup that I had ever joined. It literally had an apartment on top of this loft space and it just felt like we were a group of people who lived there and worked there. It was very communal.

## Casey Winters

- A common failure mode for startups is missing a major market shift, as Grubhub did with the rise of on-demand delivery from non-partnered restaurants.
- Startups should focus on building a 'data moat' to create a sustainable competitive advantage.
- Angel investing in 'tech debt as a service' companies can be a good strategy, as these companies solve common problems faced by many startups.

- There should always be a slide in board decks that shows the five most likely acquirers of the business and what has been done to further those relationships.

## Dan Shipper

- AI-native startups can operate with much smaller teams than traditional startups.
- Founders should focus on building a “compounding engineering” advantage by using AI to automate their own development processes, allowing them to build and iterate faster.
- Fundraising in the AI era may involve demonstrating not just a product, but also a unique AI-driven workflow or “machine” that gives the startup a competitive edge.

## Deb Liu

- Deb Liu built Facebook Marketplace from scratch, which is now used by over 1 billion people monthly.
- She also built Facebook's first mobile ad product for apps, its mobile ad network, the company's games business, and the payments platform (Facebook Pay).

## Donna Lichaw

- A common challenge for founders is imposter syndrome, especially when hiring experienced executives. This can lead to micromanagement and a lack of trust in the team.
- To overcome this, founders should focus on setting a clear vision and empowering their team to execute, rather than getting involved in the day-to-day details.

## Dylan Field

- Don't wait too long to launch. Figma took 3.5 years, which Dylan Field says was 'way too long.' Ship and get feedback as quickly as possible.
- The most important thing for aspiring entrepreneurs is to just start. The best way to learn is by doing.
- You should be a little bit embarrassed by what you ship. If you’re not, you’ve waited too long.

- The founders were more interested in building the database than the application they initially set out to build.
- The company's first customers were large enterprises that needed support for the new technology.
- The business model evolved to include an enterprise version with advanced features and a cloud-based service.

## Emily Kramer

## Grace Isford

- Ambitious founders with a strong perspective: The founders have a conviction in their belief for why the world should be the way it should be with their company in it. They often have relevant expertise, research, or a welcome-here thesis around why that will be the case. They should also have an ambitious team with a clear vision for the future. - Grace Isford
- True technology: The tech should have an IP/patent or take a different approach to solve the problem. Having a solid technological core is essential to any investment I make. - Grace Isford
- Customer love: The company should have early signs of attraction regarding qualitative or quantitative data points around why their offerings make the customer happy. These are signs of early product- and go-to-market fit. - Grace Isford
- Venture capital is the business of taking big risks and big bets. I worry that a lot of the venture industry today focuses more on safe bets - things that are not truly changing the future or being contrarian. If you think of the most amazing massive companies, a lot of them started as things most people thought were crazy, weird, or different. It has been cool to see the confluence of massive companies being built that are doing things that may seem crazy, risky, or different from the status quo. I encourage all VCs to think more from that perspective because we are trying to invest in true technology innovation (versus incremental innovation that may not change the status quo). - Grace Isford

## Hubert Palan

- The Lean Startup methodology is valuable for understanding customer pain points.
- When starting, identify a pain point and build a solution for it.

## James Mayes

- The acquisition of a smaller company by a larger one can be a strategic move for both parties, providing an exit for the founders and new capabilities for the acquirer.

## Jason Fried

- Bootstrapping is a great way for entrepreneurs to start because it forces them to learn how to make money and be profitable from the beginning.
- For software businesses, it’s relatively cheap to get started, often just requiring a couple of laptops and people.
- Before starting a bootstrapped business, you must be at peace with the worst-case scenario.
- The goal should be to build a business that you are proud of and want to continue working at for a long time.

## Jen Abel

## Keith Yandell

- The journey of a founder is characterized by a relentless drive to persevere and find solutions, no matter the obstacles.
- Persistence is key when fundraising, as it often only takes a single 'yes' to secure the necessary funding.

## Krithika Shankarraman

- Founders should avoid blindly copying marketing playbooks from other companies, as success is highly dependent on context, the competitive landscape, and the product itself.
- Before hiring for a marketing role, founders should first diagnose the specific problem they are trying to solve (e.g., lead generation vs. product positioning).

## Lauren Ipsen

- For early-stage startups, it's often better to hire a senior PM who is still close to the work rather than a very senior leader from a large company.
- Founders need to be very specific about what they need from a head of product before they start hiring.
- Recruiting through LinkedIn may not be the best use of a founder's time; tapping into their network is more effective.

## Logan Kilpatrick

- The transcript mentions that Logan Kilpatrick will share insights on the biggest opportunities for new products and startups building on OpenAI's APIs, but the specific opportunities are not detailed in the provided text.

## Marty Cagan

- As companies grow larger, the importance of the product function tends to decrease.

## Maya Prohovnik

- The importance of dogfooding is especially critical in a startup to stay close to the customer.
- The story of Anchor's acquisition by Spotify and the challenges of integrating a startup into a large corporation.

## Meltem Kuran Berkowitz

- Early-stage startups can effectively 'piggyback' on existing platforms and communities to acquire their first users, but the key is to provide value to that community rather than just promoting the product.
- Deel achieved unprecedented growth, going from less than $1 million to $295 million in ARR in just three years while maintaining profitability (EBITDA positive).

- Cursor's origin was a solution in search of a problem, born from the realization that AI could create genuinely useful products.
- The company's rapid growth was a consistent exponential curve, which felt slow at the start.

## Mihika Kapoor

- It’s not just about having a great idea or building a prototype; it’s about actively engaging and rallying others around that idea to create momentum and excitement.
- Whether it’s pitching ideas at events like hackathons or simply asking colleagues for assistance, the key is to not let perceived limitations hold you back from pursuing your vision.

## Mike Krieger

- For AI startups worried about getting crushed by big companies, focus on three moats: deep domain expertise (like Harvey in legal), differentiated go-to-market with specific customer knowledge, and completely new interaction paradigms that incumbents can’t easily copy. Plus, don’t underestimate the power of true startup urgency.
- Mike’s previous startup, Artifact, failed despite being loved because mobile web is broken, news doesn’t spread virally, and remote work made pivots nearly impossible. The biggest lesson: know when to call it. They had “10 units of input for 1 unit of output”—the energy just wasn’t there. Sometimes shutting down is the right call to free everyone up for more impactful work.

## Nabeel S. Qureshi

- Almost a third of all Palantir’s PMs go on to start companies.
- New AI tools enable less-technical employees to deliver custom solutions that previously required senior engineers, making business models viable at lower price points.

## Nikhyl Singhal

- Aspiring founders should focus on acquiring a broad range of skills, including team building and sales, not just product development.
- Many startups that were previously in a hypergrowth phase are now "ex-growth" and will likely need to pivot or restart their business.

## Nilan Peiris

- Lessons from a fast-growing and profitable tech company.
- Wise started with just the founders and no team.
- In the early days, they tried everything, hoping something would work.

## Richard Rumelt

- Startups should focus on a niche market they can dominate before expanding.

## Ronny Kohavi

- A/B testing is not just for large companies. Startups can and should use experimentation to find product-market fit and optimize their products.

## Ryan Singer

- The transition from a small, informal startup to a more structured organization often hits a breaking point at around 30-50 people, which is when a methodology like Shape Up becomes critical for maintaining momentum.
- Shape Up is designed to help scaling startups preserve the urgency and clarity of their early days while introducing just enough process to manage growth and ship consistently.
- For companies looking to adopt Shape Up, the recommended approach is to start with a pilot project with a single team to learn the methodology before attempting a broader, company-wide implementation.
- Basecamp’s history of being bootstrapped (never taking VC funding) led to a culture of slow, organic growth and a focus on sustainable, efficient work practices, which heavily influenced the development of Shape Up.

## Seth Godin

- Don’t rush to take any opportunity that comes your way. Just like a surfer picks the right wave, ensure that you’re waiting for the right moment in your business, with the right people. Mediocre work happens when you compromise on the wave, but getting the right wave means you’ll be able to excel effortlessly.

## Uri Levine

- There are two types of crises: cash crisis and product-market-fit crisis.
- In a cash crisis, you need to act quickly to reduce expenses and extend your runway.
- When you lose product-market fit, you need to re-evaluate the market and your product.
- A framework for deciding whether to pivot: validate the problem, assess your advantages, check your passion, validate with the team, and approach investors.
- As a founder, you are always responsible for navigating through crises.
- Always be prepared for a crisis by having enough runway (12-18 months is a good guideline).
- Building a startup is a journey from one crisis to the next.
- Never give up.
