# Lenny's Startup Playbook

Curated startup insights from 159 Lenny's Podcast episodes featuring founders of Airbnb, Stripe, Figma, Notion, Canva, and legendary investors from Y Combinator, a16z, and Benchmark.

## Core Principles

### Finding Product-Market Fit
- **Fall in love with the problem, not the solution** (Uri Levine): Deeply understand the problem before building.
- **Sean Ellis Test**: If 40%+ of users would be "very disappointed" without your product, you have PMF.
- **Do things that don't scale**: Manual, high-touch approaches reveal what users truly need.

### Starting Up
- **Start small**: Don't try to build a unicorn from day one. Get an initial win with something manageable.
- **Boring can be beautiful**: The best product ideas often come from unsexy, overlooked industries.
- **Founder-future fit**: Your unique combination of skills and experiences points to the right product to build.

### Fundraising
- **Conviction in founders**: Investors often bet on founders before fully understanding the market.
- **Mission over product**: Judge the mission, not the current state of the product.
- **Crisp articulation**: Special companies can clearly describe how future systems should look and feel.

### Scaling
- **Three things matter**: The product, the customer, and the company itself—not just the product.
- **CEO strength becomes weakness**: At $5-10M ARR, a founder's initial strength often becomes a bottleneck.
- **Creating change creates conflict**: Meaningful impact requires altering existing patterns and challenging interests.

### Pivoting & Perseverance
- **Re-evaluate PMF in changing markets**: Your existing product may no longer meet market needs.
- **Pivot evaluation framework**: Know when to persist and when to pivot based on clear criteria.
- **The product may have to radically change**: Even great products may need fundamental changes.
